# v3 Revision Notes

**This page documents the changes made by Claude Code to create version 3 of [[Co-creating your physical event with your online community]].** 

It was written by Claude Code in the second editing session and post-edited by me. Because this is an experimental wiki, after all. My changes are appended to the end.

## From v2 to v3: Splitting into multiple files

A previous instance of Claude Code took [[Co-creating your physical event with your online community 2|version 2 of this content]] - which was a single, very long blog post - and split it into four interlinked files:

1. **Event co-creation - main page** - the overview and entry point, summarising each topic with "Read more" links
2. **Event co-creation - the traditional approach** - the full methodology developed over 25 years (2002-2012)
3. **Implementing event co-creation on the ATmosphere** - how ATProtocol, standard.site, and Leaflet transform the approach
4. **Case study - ATProto.science 2026 experiment** - the real-world test running ahead of the Vancouver event

Each sub-page got back-links to the main page and a "Related pages" footer linking to its siblings.

## v3 revisions: Reframing and restructuring

Working from the author's instructions, I made the following changes in this session:

### Framing the article's scope

The main page's subtitle, introduction, and throughout were updated to make clear that:

- The article explores what the **ATmosphere** offers event co-creation
- It looks specifically at **standard.site** as the enabling technology
- This version focuses on the **Leaflet** implementation of standard.site
- Future versions will add sub-pages covering other standard.site implementations

### Shortening the main page subsections

The main page previously had five subsections, with two sub-pages each referenced twice. I merged these into three roughly equal subsections, each linking to its sub-page exactly once:

- **"What is Event Co-creation?" + "The Traditional Timeline"** became a single concise section defining the concept, mentioning the 6-month process briefly, and linking once to [[Event co-creation at a glance]]
- **"Why the ATmosphere Changes Everything" + "How standard.site Makes This Work"** became **"Implementing Event Co-creation on the ATmosphere"**, linking once to [[Event co-creation using Leaflet]]
- **"Testing in the Real World"** was tightened to two paragraphs to match

### Moving general content to the main page

The sub-page "Implementing event co-creation on the ATmosphere" originally opened with several sections of general content not specific to Leaflet:

- "Why Look to the Atmosphere?" (the rationale for integrating ATProto)
- "Solving the Identity Crisis" (giving users a DID and PDS at signup)
- "Benefits" (personal sovereignty and engagement reach)
- "Meet the Standard" (introducing standard.site with the Steve Dylan quote)

I moved all of this into the main page's "Implementing Event Co-creation on the ATmosphere" section, where it belongs as general ATmosphere/standard.site context. The sub-page now opens with a subtitle framing it as the Leaflet-focused implementation page, then goes straight into "Getting My Head Around Leaflet." The Leaflet walkthrough, the "So What Does This Mean for Event Co-creation?" section, and the "Handling Public Data" section were left untouched.

*By Mathew:*

Although I've only been experimenting with code for a few weeks now, I've been playing with LLMs since I got my first glimpse at GPT-2. Up until recently I was mildly sceptical of their utility for my specific use cases, as set out in early 2024 in [ChatGPT integration free trial, Bullshit, Botshit and Bubbles](https://myhub.ai/items/chatgpt-integration-free-trial-bullshit-botshit-and-bubbles-newsletter-3).

My friend Peter Kaminski, who used me as a guinea pig for developing his training programme, changed my opinion by walking me through the process of using Claude Code. Developers, of course, have known about this for a long time, but non-developers like myself can find the learning curve intimidating due to the fact that the interfaces available are mainly development tools.  

This post, however, is actually the first time I've asked it for help with editing my writing. I emphasise *editing*, not writing: *all* of the content is mine, as you can see by comparing the above multi-page version 3 post with [[Co-creating your physical event with your online community 2|version 2]], which had all of the same content in one page. It was far too long, so I asked Claude Code to break it up. And when I looked at the results, I had to edit it a lot myself. Claude Code is good - amazing, really - but it also clearly doesn't understand *meaning*.

The only way of knowing whether Claude Code really saved me any time is by running the experiment again, but that is clearly impossible.
