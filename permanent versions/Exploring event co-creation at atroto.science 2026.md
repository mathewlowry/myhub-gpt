# Exploring event co-creation at atroto.science 2026

**Experimenting with event co-creation on the ATmosphere using [leaflet.pub](https://leaflet.pub/) in the lead-up to [ATProto.science 2026](https://atproto.science/events/atmosphere2026/) (Vancouver, March 2026).**

This is written in support of [[Co-creating your physical event with your online community|Event co-creation on the Atmosphere]], so if you landed on this page directly, you might want to pop up there for the wider context. TL:DR; I'm exploring how [standard.site](https://standard.site/) could support event co-creation, and so thought I'd run a little experiment in the run up to [ATProto.science](https://atproto.science/events/atmosphere2026/) (Vancouver, March 2026) using the [leaflet.pub ](http://leaflet.pub/)implementation of standard.site.

The atproto.science organisers had already asked participants to submit event items (presentations, demos, lightning talks), selected the most interesting ones, and organised them into a conference programme (workshops composed of 3-4 event items).

While the scope for event co-creation is limited (the selection, after all, has already been made) I thought it could be interesting to see whether we could use Leaflet and Bluesky to support conversations about the event programme in the run-up to the event.
## Process

In mid February [I started publishing the selected proposals into a Leaflet publication](https://atproto2026.leaflet.pub/3mevfbw7r522w), with one subpage per workshop. My first attempt wasn't great, so Ariel Lighty joined in to improve the presentation.

Pretty soon we will invite the authors to:

* further flesh out their ideas (we provide them the edit link for their subpage)
* provoke a conversation - on Leaflet and/on Bluesky - with participants interested in their event item.

Hopefully some of the speakers will have some interesting conversations in the run-up to their workshop, which will enrich the workshop for all concerned.

And, in a perfect world, the speakers in each workshop would also work together to find the threads connecting their respective event items and elaborate a full workshop description.

## Managing expectations

Will that happen? As I write this I have no idea - that's why it's an experiment, which is appropriate enough, given that it's atproto.science.

I already know that this implementation won't be perfect. Several limitations are already clear:

* **Notifications:** As I'm the author of all the subpages, I'll be getting all the notifications of comments, not the speakers. This is a structural limitation of how I set up the experiment using Leaflet, but I imagine it's not an issue for standard.site, where each author's DID could be encoded in the event item, ensuring notifications go to the right place
* There aren't (yet) any notifications when a Leaflet is mentioned on Bluesky, or your Bluesky ID is mentioned on Leaflet
* So the speakers will have to visit their Leaflet subpage to stay on top of comments and Bluesky conversations about their event item (although if they subscribe to their page, they'll see the latter via their Leaflet Reader custom feed).

But even if there is very little interaction, at the very least I will have learnt a little bit about how Leaflet and standard.site works, which is directly relevant to my atproto.science workshop: [Coopetition in the ATmosphere](https://leaflet.pub/7c7be6b7-1dbc-4aae-8f32-f5314aa99f90?page=019c60e7-6d9d-7773-a1b3-6521afff8f21).

So if you can't make it to my workshop, let's chat about it online via the above subpage. And if you can, let me know what you'd like to bring to the discussion when we meet face2face.
