**I'm interested in exploring how we can manage competition and cooperation in the atmosphere.**

> *Coopetition is a business strategy blending cooperation and competition, where rival companies collaborate for mutual benefit, such as developing new tech or expanding markets, while still competing fiercely in other areas like pricing or features, creating a paradoxical yet strategic interdependence.*

Possibly nobody else coming to Vancouver was actually fully grown in 1995, so you're going to have to take it from me: we are living through a 1995 moment in decentralised social computing. A new protocol-based information ecosystem has appeared, and people are being incredibly creative. How do we help all these innovators cooperate - thus growing the ATmosphere to the benefit of all - *and* compete - thus demonstrating its sustainability?

The ATmosphere is already demonstrating this: independent teams have built distinct apps using shared lexicons, and different teams have already started cooperating (eg standard.site). 

What intrigues me is: 
* whether teams can create new apps by adopting, adapting and recombining lexicons and other open-source components developed by multiple teams, while maintaining credible exit
* how cooperation can be encouraged and supported to make the most of scarce resources.

## Recombining components: an example

For an example, take a look at what I want to do with my MyHub ([[MyHub.ai on the ATmosphere]]): combining components from multiple teams to create something new - a platform built from multiple components developed elsewhere that nevertheless maintains credible exit:

| Component             | What It Does                                                                                                           | Also needed by  | Their Focus                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inbox**             | Present potentially interesting content to read and integrate into your personal library and/or public online presence | Sill            | Surfacing links from your social graph across multiple lexicons |
| **Thinking Tool**     | Private notes, drafts, collaboration with friends                                                                      | NorthSky        | Private data with community boundaries                          |
| **Publishing Engine** | Publish Hubs and oter sites to web via PDS                                                                             | standard.site   | `site.standard.publication`, `site.standard.document`           |
|                       |                                                                                                                        | groundmist      | pushing local files to PDS                                      |

This table is incomplete - I would hope to complete it in Vancouver.

## Supporting cooperation

**I have developed a model which I would recommend funding organisations consider if they want to cost-effectively support the development of a portfolio of ATmosphere start-ups.** 

As it's actually the centrepiece of the funding proposal I'm putting together for the European Commission, I cannot share a detailed description before Vancouver. However I have already presented it at least to some of the people considering this proposal, so they know what it looks like. 

But, briefly, the model ensures that funding goes to support the development of components which are useful to multiple start-ups. In this model, a component is not just a piece of code: it could also include shared infrastructure - see the CoCoMo content moderation service, relays and PDSs being developed by Eurosky in Europe - and perhaps other services useful for monetization and so on.

This has two results:
* Incredibly cost-effective: you literally support multiple start-ups with a single grant
* Build cooperation between startup teams, benefiting both *and*  the ATmosphere as a whole. It can be more complex for developers in different start-ups to cooperate together, so the default state is competition, which will probably not grow the ATmosphere as a whole. *Iff* startups wish to cooperate on underlying technologies like lexicons, supporting this collaboration will help grow the entire ecosystem.
