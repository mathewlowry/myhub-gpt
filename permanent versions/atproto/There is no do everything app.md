# Building energy in the Atmosphere
**In case you're not following the development of the Atmosphere yet, I thought I'd share the snowballing energy I see every morning when I open Bluesky’s _For You_ feed.**

*(This is version 2 of this post, published on my experimental wiki using the [permanent versions pattern](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e), where I publish a string of versions as I develop my thoughts in the hope of collecting constructive criticism and ideas along the way. Version control is in the footer.)*

That energy is flying me to Vancouver for [ATmosphereConf 2026](https://ti.to/atmosphereconf/atmosphereconf2026) in late March to explore how this incredible technology can change the way we do science. A huge shoutout to [Cosmik Network](https://cosmik.network/), the team behind the [Semble curation app](https://semble.so/), for sponsoring my travel costs. If you have any questions you'd like me to ask when I get there, just reach out via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mathewlowry.bsky.social) or [my Hub](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/about/#contact).
## One morning's news

What follows is a quick summary of the sort of thing I see when I open my phone every morning and navigate to Bluesky's [For You feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3guzzweuqraryl3rdkimjamk/feed/for-you). In this case it was Thursday, 5 February:

- My friends in the Eurosky team announced the first migrations to @Eurosky hosting. Hopefully my invite is on the way. **Register at** [**https://www.eurosky.tech/**](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eeurosky%2Etech%2F&urlhash=dKqL&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)
- The Margin and Symbol teams [announced they’re now interoperable](https://notes.cosmik.network/3me2iifnwic2x) with the bookmarks you create using [Margin](https://margin.at/) ("*Write on the margins of the internet*") appearing in your [Semble](https://semble.so/) collections ("*Collect interesting links, add notes, and organize them into shareable collections. Build trails others can explore and extend.*")
- Someone called [TreeThought](https://bsky.app/profile/treethought.xyz/post/3me3mv3fbmc25) just made it possible to publish your Obsidian notes (text files which you can sync between all your devices without being locked in) to the Atmosphere using **[standard.site](http://standard.site)**, a long-form web publishing approach developed cooperatively by three separate teams — Offprint, Leaflet, and Pckt — a few weeks ago. And the integration's bidirectional: you can also browse your subscribed Atmosphere publications and clip them to your Obsidian notes. [**Download & install**](https://github.com/treethought/obsidian-atmosphere)
- Meanwhile, Leaflet started to [crowdsource ideas](https://bsky.app/profile/leaflet.pub/post/3mdy7ro5fbc2g) for premium features , while [pckt.blog](http://pckt.blog/) announced a new tool for migrating your Atmosphere blog from WhiteWind (the first Atmosphere blogging tool) to [standard.site](http://standard.site) 
- And Dan demoed a new publishing interface which even he [cannot completely explain](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3me3baf46xk2w)
- Finally, a chap called Andreas “_Went to an ATProto meetup, got inspired, built a thing!_ [_Octosphere_](https://andreasthinks.me/posts/octosphere/octosphere.html) _… turns your Octopus research into distributed records that others can react to, respond to and build on”_. 

## Coopetition in Vancouver

Andreas's work is not limited to cephalopod research by the way — [https://octopus.ac](https://octopus.ac/) is a reimagination of scientific publishing in a modular and open form, developed with the funding of the British government’s research funding body. 

It'll be discussed, along with Semble and many other science-oriented Atmosphere apps, at [atproto.science](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fatproto%2Escience&urlhash=QUwu&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) where I'll run a workshop on how best to encourage this sort of [Coopetition in the ATmosphere](https://experiments.myhub.ai/permanent_versions/atproto/vancouver/coopetition_in_the_atmosphere). I expect this post to evolve *a lot* in the next few weeks.

## Sensemaking posts

Finally, my morning was completed by two blog posts trying to capture and explain the long-term potential of this cooperative energy:

* [The Last Social Account You'll Ever Need](https://blog.joebasser.com/3mdvuirqog22z), by the creator of video-sharing app Spark, now in open beta  
* [The Everything Account](https://www.augment.ink/the-everything-account/ ), by the CEO of [A New Social](https://anew.social/?ref=augment.ink), which builds tools like [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/?ref=augment.ink), which bridges open social media protocols (think Mastodon <-> Bluesky)

Note that not all of these posts came out exactly on 5 February, but they were all at the top of my [For You feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3guzzweuqraryl3rdkimjamk/feed/for-you) (which finds posts you liked, finds other people who liked the same posts, and shows you other posts they liked) when I glanced at it first thing. For You was developed by [SpaceCowboy](https://bsky.app/profile/spacecowboy17.bsky.social) and runs on his gaming PC because, why not? 

Other recent posts I'd recommend in the same vein include:

* [ Atmospheric Computing](https://www.pfrazee.com/blog/atmospheric-computing) by Bluesky engineer Paul Frazee (*December 31, 2025*)
* [A Social Filesystem](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/) by the elusive Dan, mentioned earlier (*January 18, 2026*)
