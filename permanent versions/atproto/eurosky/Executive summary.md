## About

**The mission of the executive summary is quite simple:**

- to set out the Why, What, How, When (and even mention the Who) of the entire programme.
- to emphasise these key messages
    - the different parts of the work programme support each other synergistically
    - together this is the most cost effective way the European Commission has of **simultaneously**:
        - supporting startups in this new frontier
        - defending european democracy
        - reducing the toxicity of the online environment
        - supporting news media

## Logic

The idea driving this workprogramme is that EuroSky could win funding from public sources by **cost-effectively** lifting and supporting **a cohort of startups** in this new ecosystem, the ATmosphere.
## How?

An image is usually a good place to start (early October version) ![[Pasted image 20251207180944.png]]

It shows 4 workpackages:

* It looks a lot _like_ an incubator because there’s a **portfolio of startups**, all of which have signed the [[Eurosky Covenant]], which you need to sign it to get access to …
- **Eurosky Commons:** CoCoMo and other “components” useful to multiple Eurosky startups, and so are developed with Eurosky support
    - all startups shown are using CoCoMo
    - the second startup is Sponsor for Component B, but no other startup is interested in it so it has a low chance of support
    - but the second startup _will_ benefit from Components C & E, which are useful to 1-2 other startups
- mentoring support, which is part of the **Consultancy and Mentoring workpackage**

Underpinning all of this are a set of **criteria** which are used to identify which startups and components to support. As stated above, components are more likely to be developed if they benefit multiple startups. But other criteria are also possible - some are suggested.

**This is a highly cost-effective strategy because:**

- resources are focused on components (services and products) of use to multiple startups
- the Eurosky resources spent on developing those components, wherever possible, is disbursed to the startups - ie
    - the startups themselves define what they need
    - we financially help startups build components that both they and others require
    - everything is open sourced, available to all
- the process of identifying those components will therefore help build a developer community
- every startup we support helps develop the ATmosphere, which supports all the _other_ startups

**NOTES:**

- Eurosky could actually _be_ an incubator if it gave _direct_ financial support to individual startups. But this may be too ambitions for our first year of existence. What we can say is that:
    - one of our primary goals is to get our portfolio of startups to the point where they can get investment, hence the mentoring activities.
    - if we do start supporting individual startups, we should consider a **retroactive funding process,** providing grants to teams who have already proven they have delivered something people want - eg by providing matching funds to crowdsourcing campaigns, or helping a team scale to cope with a successful launch…

So the obvious workprogramme structure is to have one chapter (workpackage) on each.
