The Eurosky commons is a set of “components” - services, a code library, etc. - useful to multiple Eurosky startups. By developing the commons we support multiple startups.

[[CoCoMo]] is one example, probably useful to all Eurosky startups. Others may be code library components, which can be developed by one or some startups to benefit many. 

These will need to be identified using some sort of process. It’s important that any proposal we make sets out that process in enough detail to be credible - **ideally, we show it already in action on a pilot project cohort before we submit a proposal for funding it.**
## Commons development pipeline

The pipeline has 5 steps:
### 1. Ideation

A startup describes themselves in [[Eurosky projects]], and in their description they describe components which they think might be useful to other startups.

Other startups support it by linking their project to it, in the process adding their requirements for the component.

If a component gets enough support it goes to stage 2.

Note that there are several criteria at work, here, not just the number of startups that would find it useful - see: [[Eurosky criteria]].

### 2. Definition phase

When a component enters stage 2 all we know is

- how many startups would find the component useful
- each of them has set out an outline of their requirements

From this a consensus on what the component is and does must be developed. The conversation therefore continues between interested project teams and the central team. The goal is to define a feature that meets the needs of multiple team, creating economies of scale, with enough detail so

- all projects who support the component know what they'll get and are satisfied it meets their needs
- the development cost can be estimated in step 3

When this goal is reached it moves to Step 3.

### 3. Go/NoGo?

This is a cost-benefit calculation:

- the development is costed by the central team
- we know how many projects want it (they might be able to give it a sliding scale of votes, eg 0-3)

Those at the top move to Step 4.

### 4. Development

The component is developed according to the description developed in step 2.

There are options for who does it:

1. central development: eurosky builds the component
2. auction: different teams bid to build it. The best offer wins a grant from Eurosky, which doens’t pay the complete amount until it is satisfied that the component meets the description developed in step 2
3. Sponsor builds it: the team which originally proposed the component builds it
4. Consortium: some/all of the teams which want the component are given a grant to build it

### 5. Delivery & Publication

The development is published open source.
