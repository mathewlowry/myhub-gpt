## At a glance

This workpackage contains several interrelated activities:

- mentoring projects: classic incubator services to mentor Eurosky startups
- consultancy projects: growing the ATmosphere by helping priority sectors (see criteria) get more value out of it and thus make the transition
- Research:
    - carrying out original research to support the development of the ATmosphere and the businesses within it
    - “ATproto University”: meet the crying need for **high-quality public content** explaining the ATmosphere and how to get the most out of it

These activities belong together because:

- the consultancy projects and research should result in as much public content as possible: case studies, guidelines, blog posts, etc.
- providing this public content is one way of providing consultancy services to large numbers of organisations cost-effectively.

## For this we will need

- team
    - startup mentors
    - comms consultants with experience with **priority sectors**
        - government 
        - news organisations: 
        - tbc
    - Writers/Editors:
