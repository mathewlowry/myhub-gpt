## what this is (not)

This collection of pages, images, slides, etc will be source material from which we will extract content for funding proposals for Eurosky projects as they arise. Completing it is useful not just to be prepared for the proposal writing stage, but also to identify if and where we need any partnerships. It’s _not_ vital that it be beautifully written, as we will probably need different parts for different opportunities, and to rewrite each part for each one. So it’s raw material.

## Wider context

- this is not Eurosky’s workprogramme: Eurosky is FreeOurFeeds’ project in Europe - ie it implements the FoF workprogramme in Europe
- This workprogramme is raw material with which to get funding for Eurosky _projects_
    - Eurosky may do many things - eg core work + multiple projects
    - some Eurosky projects may have partners
