# There is no do everything app. There is a do everything ecosystem
**And it's being built before our eyes.**

*(This is published on my experimental wiki using the [permanent versions pattern](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e), where I publish a string of versions as I develop my thoughts in the hope of collecting constructive criticism and ideas along the way. Version control is in the footer.)*

A typical morning for me when I open my phone and navigate to Bluesky's For You feed, developed by a user and run on his gaming PC:

My friends in the Eurosky team announces the first migrations to @Eurosky hosting. Hopefully my invite is on the way. Register at [https://www.eurosky.tech/](https://www.eurosky.tech/)

The Margin and Symbol teams announced that they're now interoperable: ["Your Margin bookmarks now show up directly on Semble" ](https://notes.cosmik.network/3me2iifnwic2x?auth_completed=true).

Someone I never heard of called TreeThought just made it possible to publish your Obsidian notes to the Atmosphere using [standard.site](standard.site), a long-form publishing approach developed cooperatively by three separate teams - Offprint, Leaflet, and pckt.blog - a few weeks ago. You can also browse your subscribed publications and clip them to your Obsidian notes, which is simply a folder of text files on your PC which you can sync between all your devices without being locked in. Download & install! [https://github.com/treethought/obsidian-atmosphere](https://github.com/treethought/obsidian-atmosphere)

Meanwhile Leaflet are [crowdsourcing ideas for premium options](https://bsky.app/profile/leaflet.pub/post/3mdy7ro5fbc2g), which will almost certainly be a major topic of conversation at the conference session on Atmospheric Publishing they are preparing for [Vancouver next month](https://ti.to/atmosphereconf/atmosphereconf2026), while pckt.blog [announced](https://bsky.app/profile/pckt.blog/post/3mdq7tgmr5k23) a new tool for migrating your Atmosphere blog from WhiteWind (the first long-form blogging tool on the Atmosphere) to standard.site (which Ewan, showing the cooperative spirit of the place, [recommended it over his own](https://bsky.app/profile/ewancroft.uk/post/3mdzkuuzqcs2y)). Meanwhile Dan [demoed a new publishing interface ](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3me3baf46xk2w)which even he cannot completely explain.

I'll be in Vancouver, too, particularly for the [ATProto.science](ATProto.science) day, where the keynote speakers will be some of the leading voices in open science. Speaking of which, another app just launched yesterday, after a chap called Andreas "Went to an ATProto meetup, got inspired, built a thing! Octosphere is an experimental bridge between [www.octopus.ac](https://www.octopus.ac/) and the Atmosphere, turning your Octopus research into distributed records that others can react to, respond to and build on". https://andreasthinks.me/posts/octosphere/octosphere.html

*(This is not limited to cephalopod research by the way - [Octopus](https://octopus.ac/) is a reimagination of scientific publishing in a modular and open form, developed with the funding of the British government's research funding body).*

Trying to document all of this in real-time, a couple of recent blog posts set out the long-term potential of this cooperative energy:

* The Last Social Account You'll Ever Need, by the creator of video-sharing app Spark, now in open beta  https://blog.joebasser.com/3mdvuirqog22z
* The Everything Account, by the CEO of a new social, which builds tools like [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/?ref=augment.ink), which  bridges open social media protocols (think Mastodon <-> Bluesky): https://www.augment.ink/the-everything-account/
