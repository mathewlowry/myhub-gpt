# Welcome to the MyHub.ai "Experiments wiki"

**This is not my main site.**

*(This is version 2 of this homepage, published on my experimental wiki using the [permanent versions pattern](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e). Version control in the footer.)*

If you've stumbled here by mistake, it might be better to start with [my About Page](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/about/) on [my Hub](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/), where you'll find all the things I Like, Think and do. 

I created this massive wiki to share with a more limited audience my unfinished drafts and ideas. There are two main subjects:

## Decentralised collective intelligence

This is the big picture underpinning everything I'm working on. A good place to start is my 4 blog posts from 1 January, 2023:  [A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4).

More recently I began exploring the different information ecosystems that could support these ideas (see [[AI4Communities intro]]), and right now (Q1 2025) I'm focusing on the ATmosphere - the ecosystem underpinned by ATproto, the protocol developed for Bluesky.

## Adding the ".ai" to "myhub.ai"

Adding an LLM to MyHub.ai has been the idea from the outset (the hint's in the TLD), with the longterm goal being "*creating a decentralised, open-source ecosystem ... developing cooperatively-owned AI engines to benefit society as a whole*" ([How Artificial Intelligence will finance Collective Intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b)).

But as anyone who has played with any LLM knows, getting the best out of them is not easy. You need to try stuff out, compare results and try some more. You need, in other words, to experiment.

The quickest way to experiment with integrating an LLM into MyHub.ai was to integrate ChatGPT with it and let MyHub.ai Early Adopters play with it (see [ChatGPT integration free trial, Bullshit, Botshit and Bubbles](https://myhub.ai/items/chatgpt-integration-free-trial-bullshit-botshit-and-bubbles-newsletter-3)), so I thought I'd share my research as I go. And given that I manage my research notes in Obsidian, sharing them here via a **massive wiki** was the obvious solution (read more [[about this massive wiki]]).  

### Starting points

* Today: [How to chat with ChatGPT about your content (v2)](https://myhub.ai/items/how-to-chat-with-chatgpt-about-your-content-v1) explains how MyHub/ChatGPT *currently* works. If you're a MyHub Early Adopter, this is a good place to start 
	* Note: if you have your own ChatGPT API key you'll be able to chat with ChatGPT about your content without limits.
* Tomorrow: How (do I currently imagine) will the LLM integration into MyHub.ai look like in future? See [[LLM integration plans]]

### Research

* [[experiment log]]: the actual experiments
* [[experimental methods]]: how I'm carrying out this research 
* The various [[agent prompts and gpts]] and [[summarisers in summary]] used in the experiments
* [[Ideas log]] where I drop ideas for future experiments and blog posts as I go.
