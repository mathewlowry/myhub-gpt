Like [[experiment 7]] and [[experiment 8]], here I'm riffing off yet another [excerpt from the LinkedIn #ZNLive chat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7141374267895468032/), which covered the opportunities missed by organisations as diverse as the news industry and the European Commission when they outsourced their relationship with their audiences to social media walled gardens (see the [full interview on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7138431781808107520/)), and the new opps provided by not only the fediverse ([[experiment 8]]) but also on-site communities and good old newsletters (cf Substack).

* the ZNLive chat https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7141374267895468032/
* Collection 9: this collection comes in two parts
	* I started with 5 resources tagged #Substack: https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=substack&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all
	* I then introduced the best stuff tagged #EU and #Community: https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=best&types=like&types=do&types=think&tags=community&tags=eu&timeframe=anytime (all mine, as I was worried I'd nuke the token window if I included [everything](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&types=like&types=do&types=think&tags=community&tags=eu&timeframe=anytime))
* prompt: I started with [[prompt 5 - ideate]]
* response: [[C-9-S-0-p5-response]]
* analysis:
	* some of the first set of ideas looked intriguing, but I blew it by then adding just my own resources to generate the second - unsurprisingly, examples of everything it came up with can be found in my CV. I shouldn't need to be warned against the dangers of [echo chambers](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=echo+chamber&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all)
