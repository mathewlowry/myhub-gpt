I thought I'd followup on the interview I did with ZN. The full interview is here on linkedin, but they are also producing a series of snippets, each shared separately. 

## Snippet 1

#### Process

[This part of the interview](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zn_znlive-onestepahead-onestepahead-activity-7140690237466292224-8p9i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) focused on how a properly integrated comms strategy inevitably repositions the comms team from being a "peripheral megaphone" for the organisation to an interface between it and rest of world, and thus strategically central to the organisation's actual business. 

From my notes as I listened to the segment:

* listening to the audience (needed for engagement anyway)
* but also bringing knowledge inside
	* hence KM + internal comms
	* ensure org knows what it knows
		* essential for external comms, 
		* but everyone else benefits too
	* involves comms team in core business
* most difficult challenge organisational, not technological
* True communications STRATEGY
	* nor a separate strategy
	* comms as part of the org's strategy: business intelligence, internal KM & comms, external comms

So I created a collection - [All the Stuff I Like or Do or Think about Everything tagged internal communications & communications,  Anytime]( https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=internal+communications&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=communications) , 9 resources at the time - to create [[C-7-allnotes]].

I then launched chatgpt, creating [[c-7-allnotes-conversation]]:

* used [[rss to clean notes prompt]]
* applied [[prompt 2c - themes and resources visualised]] and [[prompt 2d - themes and resources visualised]] to visualise the themes covered by this collection:

The conversation then continued as I used the visualisation to query ChatGPT's analysis . It agreed with every point I made, of course, (the true problem with LLMs is they don't even try to argue their corner) giving me:

I then asked it: "Please now reproduce your list of themes and related articles provided earlier, but with the following changes: reflect the connections in the above visualisation; and link the titles of the resources to their URLs, provided in the RSS feed."

This gave me something interesting enough to publish separately.
