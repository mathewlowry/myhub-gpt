# experiment 8

Like [[experiment 7]], here I'm riffing off a second extract from a #ZNLive interview I did with ZN  (see the [full interview on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7138431781808107520/)).

One of my main goals was to see how much difference there is in the quality of responses between:

* a conversation using the current  [[pilot MyHub ChatGPT integration]], with the inbuilt "Summariser 0" 
* using the full notes.

Unfortunately, the collection I chose was too long for the "full notes" approach, so I used only the best resources. Still makes for an interesting comparison.

## Files

* [a 2m07 chat on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140976711302545408/) on alternative social media and their implications for communication strategies. 
* **Collection 8**: there are actually 2 collections in this experiment:
	* Collection 8-1 (URL): [everything tagged #fediverse](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=fediverse&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all)(42 resources), processed via Summariser 0 using [[pilot MyHub ChatGPT integration]]
	* [[C-8-2-allnotes]]: as the entire notes of all 42 resources was too long for ChatGPT's context window to even summarise them, this collection was created by putting the rss feed of [ the 17 *best* resources tagged #fediverse](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=best&types=like&types=do&types=think&tags=fediverse&timeframe=anytime) through [[rss to clean notes prompt]].
* prompt: a custom prompt: "I am interested in the possibilities offered by the "fediverse" - open, decentralised social media networks. I will give you some resources, I want you to suggest ways that organisations can use these networks to build online communities on their own websites, deeply interconnected with the wider Fediverse. Here are the resources:"
* **response**s:  
	* feeding C-8-1 directly into ChatGPT integration gave [[C-8-1-S-0-response]] 
	* feeding C-8-2 back into ChatGPT with similar questions gave [[C-8-2-allnotes-response]]
* **analysis**: *full analysis to be done*
