1. **All my toots gone**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/all-my-toots-gone-e844f7c5f255)
   Exactly one year after publishing "Am I on the right Mastodon instance?", I discover that I wasn’t: "I’ve lost everything — posts, follows, followers, the lot.... the admin confirmed that he’d shut it down because donations were insufficient and he could no longer afford to pay the server costs from his own pocket". No great loss: "months ago I’d concluded that Mastodon wasn’t fit for purpose. I only returned this week to find that the Israel-Hamas issue had turned Mastodon into Twix... Social infrastructure needs to deliver content as a basic minimum... \[which] takes time, money and professionalism. A better business model is required".

2. **Social knowledge graphs for collective intelligence**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/social-knowledge-graphs-for-collective-intelligence-75c436889320)
   The second in my 1/1/2023 bundle of 5 posts exploring collective intelligence looks at the role of decentralised social networks: "A personalised, decentralised Social Knowledge Graph for each user multiplies the knowledge available to them via a trusted network of Followers and Friends, and creating collaborative possibilities more akin to wikis than blogging".

3. **Am I on the right Mastodon instance?**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/am-i-on-the-right-mastodon-instance-a0aee14ca00f)
   My second post following my personal #twittermigration: "the other users on your instance create its collective intelligence — the nearest thing you have to a content discovery algorithm". Not that I like algorithms, but "Apart from hashtags, ,,, your server’s Local and Federated timelines \[are your] primary discovery channels when you’re getting started". So can instances become echo chambers, and how can ew avoid simply projecting the Brussels Bubble into the Fediverse? Read on...

4. **How to Leave Dying Social Media Platforms | by Cory Doctorow | Oct, 2022 | Medium**
   [Link](https://doctorow.medium.com/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms-9fc550fe5abf)
   Those who've read Doctorow's books and blogs on the collective action problem stopping people leave the established social media walled gardens may not find anything new, except for the quite brilliant link he makes with "the 1971 film adaptation of Fiddler on the Roof ... the Anatevkans can’t just pack up and leave: they are being held hostage…by each other... They love each other. They need each other. And despite that, when it’s finally time to go, they can’t all agree on where to go next". Hence the advantage of the Fediverse: "You don’t have to convince your friends to join the same server as you... so long as your friends choose servers that your server connects to... . And if the people who run your server make life intolerable ... you can switch to another server and your messages and links to your friends will follow you there". (although I think only the friends, not the messages, follow - tbc).

5. **Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob (#TwitterMigration, day 3)**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/welcome-to-the-fediverse-starry-eyed-noob-twittermigration-day-3-57b99350414)
   I discovered the Fediverse as I kicked MyHub.ai’s shiny new tyres in early 2020, and I’m kicking myself now for not diving in then.

6. **Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b)

7. **From Personal to Social Knowledge Graphs: a vision statement**

   I've been invited to write a chapter for an upcoming book on Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKG). My chapter will encompass each user’s PKG, the Social Knowledge Graph created by networking them together via the Fediverse, Solid hosting, AI writing tools and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.

8. **The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral | Hapgood**
   [Link](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)
   Mike Caulfield in 2015, when my first hub was only about 2 years old, had also "been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki... instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew." This experience "has radically changed me... It’s like trying to explain literature to someone who has never read a book... the predominant form of the social web — that amalgam of blogging, Twitter, Facebook, forums, Reddit, Instagram — is an impoverished model for learning and research".

9. **Facebook Is Dead (It Just Doesn’t Know It Yet)**
   [Link](https://bettermarketing.pub/facebook-is-dead-it-just-doesnt-know-it-yet-614e723e9f72)
   Interesting piece on the reverse side of the network effect: the more people leave, the faster the remainder leave. So what will make people leave? Gen Z want privacy, hate bullying/speech, don’t like ads and think "Facebook is for moms and grandparents". "Millennials Are Ready to Ditch... too old to bicker with strangers... \[and] still remember those wonderful days of analog friendship". The far right and left are already leaving for dedicated echo chambers.
