2. Oops! We Automated Bullshit
   URL: [https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/blog/afb21/oops-we-automated-bullshit](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/blog/afb21/oops-we-automated-bullshit)
   According to:

   - MIT Professor of AI Rodney Brooks, ChatGPT "“just makes up stuff that sounds good"... where “sounds good” is an algorithm to imitate text found on the internet, while “makes up” is the basic randomness of relying on predictive text rather than logic or facts",
   - Geoff Hinton: "the greatest risks is not that chatbots will become super-intelligent, but that they will generate text that is super-persuasive without being intelligent, in the manner of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson",
   - Harry Frankfurt "explains that the bullshitter “does not reject the authority of truth, as the liar does […] He pays no attention to it ... bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are”",
   - Graeber’s famous analysis of Bullshit Jobs ... revealed that over 30% of British workers believe their own job contributes nothing of any value to society... writing pointless reports, relaying messages from one person to another, or listening to complaints they can do nothing about... [all] easily done by ChatGPT... we train people for bullshit jobs by training them to generate bullshit.

3. What kind of bubble is AI?
   URL: [https://doctorow.medium.com/what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai-d02040b5573a](https://doctorow.medium.com/what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai-d02040b5573a)
   "All economic bubbles are hugely destructive, but some ... leave behind (useful) wreckage that can be salvaged":

   - the first dotcom bubble left behind "cheap servers, office furniture and space... a generation of young people ,,, trained as web makers... technologists from non-technical backgrounds"
   - crypto bubble: "a smattering of Rust programmers... bad digital art and worse Austrian economics"

   Which type is the AI bubble? We'll have "a legion of technologists who are learning Tensorflow and Pytorch", but while "nominally open source" they're bound to Google and Facebook - "if those environments go away, those programming skills become a lot less useful."

4. A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI Releases Sensational New AI Model
   URL: [https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/a-quiet-revolution-mistral-ai-releases-sensational-new-ai-model-c17c663287f0](https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/a-quiet-revolution-mistral-ai-releases-sensational-new-ai-model-c17c663287f0)
   "startup Mistral AI posted a download link to their latest language model". In many ways it's equivalent to GPT4: context size of 32k tokens, and built using the “Mixture Of Experts” model, combining "several highly specialized language models... 8 experts with 7 billion parameters each: “8x7B”... a training method for AI systems in which, instead of a single model learning everything, a combination of sub-models is used", with a gating network " assigning tasks to the experts" and combining their insights.

5. Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…
   URL: [https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6](https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6)
   At an AI conference, Jeff Jarvis "knew I was in the right place when I heard AGI brought up and quickly dismissed... I call bullshit... large language models might prove to be a parlor trick". The rest of the conference focused on "frameworks for discussion of responsible use of AI".

6. I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened
   URL: [https://medium.com/the-generator/i-trained-chatgpt-on-my-notes-heres-what-happened-1dcb48725f45](https://medium.com/the-generator/i-trained-chatgpt-on-my-notes-heres-what-happened-1dcb48725f45)
   Like me, the author has "been taking notes for over a decade ...ended up with thousands of notes that I never revisited. So I decided to train ChatGPT on my 3,743 Obsidian notes", which were created for "one purpose: content creation. So I use an improved version of the Zettelkasten".

<title>I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened</title>
<link>https://medium.com/the-generator/i-trained-chatgpt-on-my-notes-heres-what-happened-1dcb48725f45</link>
<description><p data-block-key="vs1yr">Like me, the author has &quot;been taking notes for over a decade ...ended up with thousands of notes that I never revisited. So I decided to train ChatGPT on my 3,743 Obsidian notes&quot;, which were created for &quot;one purpose: content creation. So I use an <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-the-zettelkasten-radically-changed-my-way-of-creating-content-and-how-it-will-change-yours-baa23904f034">improved version of the Zettelkasten</a>&quot;.</p><p data-block-key="agnt5">Apparently there are just 3 ways to use AI in your notes:</p><ol><li data-block-key="3uuja">... within each note ... features like: completion, summarizing, rewriting, etc.&quot; Like me, the author&#x27;s not a fan, as these features disengage your mind from the content, and you won&#x27;t &quot;“own” and internalize the information&quot;.</li><li data-block-key="e866g">&quot;find relevant notes/link notes together&quot; - the author finds no added value here, but perhaps because he used one particular plugin and has a very specific, &quot;one link per note&quot; rule for content discovery</li><li data-block-key="d29q6">&quot;Use AI to interact with your notes... uploads your notes to OpenAI and trains GPT on it... you can then interact with your notes within Obsidian... [via] a chat window ... if you start the chat with “based on my notes”&quot;. However, &quot;it missed on a bunch of other insights ... I was disappointed&quot;</li></ol><p data-block-key="pha0">PS the plugin tested in (3) was probably Smart Connections:</p><embed embedtype="media" url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHY3OHUNOrQ"/><p data-block-key="fb7fi"></p><p>Tags: productivity, ai, obsidian, chatgpt, embedding, smart connections</p></description>
