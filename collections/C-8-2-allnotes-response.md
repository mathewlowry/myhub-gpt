# Fediverse Community Building Strategies

#### You:
I am interested in the possibilities offered by the "fediverse" - open, decentralised social media networks. I will give you some resources, I want you to suggest ways that organisations can use these networks to build online communities on their own websites, deeply interconnected with the wider Fediverse. Here are the resources: 
**All my toots gone**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/all-my-toots-gone-e844f7c5f255)
   Exactly one year after publishing "Am I on the right Mastodon instance?", I discover that I wasn’t: "I’ve lost everything — posts, follows, followers, the lot.... the admin confirmed that he’d shut it down because donations were insufficient and he could no longer afford to pay the server costs from his own pocket". No great loss: "months ago I’d concluded that Mastodon wasn’t fit for purpose. I only returned this week to find that the Israel-Hamas issue had turned Mastodon into Twix... Social infrastructure needs to deliver content as a basic minimum... \[which] takes time, money and professionalism. A better business model is required".

2. **Social knowledge graphs for collective intelligence**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/social-knowledge-graphs-for-collective-intelligence-75c436889320)
   The second in my 1/1/2023 bundle of 5 posts exploring collective intelligence looks at the role of decentralised social networks: "A personalised, decentralised Social Knowledge Graph for each user multiplies the knowledge available to them via a trusted network of Followers and Friends, and creating collaborative possibilities more akin to wikis than blogging".

3. **Am I on the right Mastodon instance?**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/am-i-on-the-right-mastodon-instance-a0aee14ca00f)
   My second post following my personal #twittermigration: "the other users on your instance create its collective intelligence — the nearest thing you have to a content discovery algorithm". Not that I like algorithms, but "Apart from hashtags, ,,, your server’s Local and Federated timelines \[are your] primary discovery channels when you’re getting started". So can instances become echo chambers, and how can ew avoid simply projecting the Brussels Bubble into the Fediverse? Read on...

4. **How to Leave Dying Social Media Platforms | by Cory Doctorow | Oct, 2022 | Medium**
   [Link](https://doctorow.medium.com/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms-9fc550fe5abf)
   Those who've read Doctorow's books and blogs on the collective action problem stopping people leave the established social media walled gardens may not find anything new, except for the quite brilliant link he makes with "the 1971 film adaptation of Fiddler on the Roof ... the Anatevkans can’t just pack up and leave: they are being held hostage…by each other... They love each other. They need each other. And despite that, when it’s finally time to go, they can’t all agree on where to go next". Hence the advantage of the Fediverse: "You don’t have to convince your friends to join the same server as you... so long as your friends choose servers that your server connects to... . And if the people who run your server make life intolerable ... you can switch to another server and your messages and links to your friends will follow you there". (although I think only the friends, not the messages, follow - tbc).

5. **Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob (#TwitterMigration, day 3)**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/welcome-to-the-fediverse-starry-eyed-noob-twittermigration-day-3-57b99350414)
   I discovered the Fediverse as I kicked MyHub.ai’s shiny new tyres in early 2020, and I’m kicking myself now for not diving in then.

6. **Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs**
   [Link](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b)
   Writing a chapter for a book on Personal Knowledge Graphs made me rethink MyHub.ai, and led to a new collective intelligence pilot project with the founders of massive.wiki.

7. **From Personal to Social Knowledge Graphs: a vision statement**
   [Link](https://medium.com/@mathewlowry/from-personal-to-social-knowledge-graphs-a-vision-statement-draft-fc86ef4f7022)
   I've been invited to write a chapter for an upcoming book on Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKG). My chapter will encompass each user’s PKG, the Social Knowledge Graph created by networking them together via the Fediverse, Solid hosting, AI writing tools and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.

8. **The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral | Hapgood**
   [Link](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)
   Mike Caulfield in 2015, when my first hub was only about 2 years old, had also "been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki... instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew." This experience "has radically changed me... It’s like trying to explain literature to someone who has never read a book... the predominant form of the social web — that amalgam of blogging, Twitter, Facebook, forums, Reddit, Instagram — is an impoverished model for learning and research".

9. **Facebook Is Dead (It Just Doesn’t Know It Yet)**
   [Link](https://bettermarketing.pub/facebook-is-dead-it-just-doesnt-know-it-yet-614e723e9f72)
   Interesting piece on the reverse side of the network effect: the more people leave, the faster the remainder leave. So what will make people leave? Gen Z want privacy, hate bullying/speech, don’t like ads and think "Facebook is for moms and grandparents". "Millennials Are Ready to Ditch... too old to bicker with strangers... \[and] still remember those wonderful days of analog friendship". The far right and left are already leaving for dedicated echo chambers.

    The article proposes a shift from platform-centric to protocol-centric internet, focusing on the benefits of open protocols for free speech, privacy, and new business models. It discusses the potential for more decentralized and user-controlled digital public spaces.

13. **Adversarial Interoperability | Electronic Frontier Foundation**

#### ChatGPT:
To explore ways organizations can build online communities using decentralized social networks within the Fediverse, it's essential to consider the resources you provided. Here are some strategies and considerations based on these insights:

1. **Leverage Social Knowledge Graphs**: As mentioned in "Social knowledge graphs for collective intelligence," personalized social knowledge graphs can enhance the collective intelligence of a community. Organizations can develop systems where each member's personal knowledge graph is interconnected, creating a rich, collaborative network akin to wikis.

2. **Choose the Right Instance**: "Am I on the right Mastodon instance?" highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate server in the Fediverse. Organizations should choose or create an instance that aligns with their goals and culture, ensuring a suitable environment for their community.

3. **Address Sustainability Concerns**: The closure of the Mastodon instance in "All my toots gone" underscores the need for a sustainable business model. Organizations should consider funding models that ensure long-term viability, such as memberships, donations, or sponsorships.

4. **Facilitate Easy Transition and Interoperability**: As suggested in "How to Leave Dying Social Media Platforms," organizations should make it easy for users to transition from traditional social media to their platform, ensuring that links to friends and content are maintained.

5. **Promote Diverse and Inclusive Spaces**: To avoid echo chambers, as discussed in various articles, organizations should encourage diversity in their online communities. This involves fostering an environment where multiple viewpoints are respected and encouraged.

6. **Implement Effective Moderation**: The challenges of moderation in decentralized networks, as seen in "Decentralized Social Networks vs. The Trolls," mean organizations must establish clear codes of conduct and employ both automated and human moderation to maintain a healthy community.

7. **Explore New Technological Approaches**: Inspired by "Protocols, Not Platforms" and "Adversarial Interoperability," organizations can adopt innovative technological approaches that prioritize user control and data privacy, challenging the dominance of traditional social media platforms.

8. **Create 'Online Parks'**: Drawing from "To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online Parks," organizations can conceptualize their online spaces as digital public parks, fostering a sense of collective identity and responsible stewardship.

9. **Utilize ActivityPub**: As detailed in "What is ActivityPub, and how will it change the internet?", organizations should consider integrating ActivityPub into their platforms, allowing for cross-platform communication and decentralized content sharing.

10. **Encourage Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**: Based on insights from "Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs," organizations should facilitate knowledge sharing and collaborative projects, leveraging the collective intelligence of the community.

11. **Address Political and Social Polarization**: In light of the migration of certain groups to platforms like Parler (as in "How Some Conservatives Have Switched to Parler, Rumble and Newsmax"), organizations should be mindful of political and social polarization, striving to maintain balanced and respectful discourse.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can effectively harness the potential of the Fediverse to build vibrant, sustainable, and interconnected online communities on their own websites.

#### You:
I want you to explore how points 4 (Content Management System (CMS)) and 9 (Social Media Integration with various Fediverse platforms) work together by answering the following questions:  
a) Imagine a community member who has a Fediverse account. Does she use her Fediverse account to create an account on my community website, or are her Fediverse account and her community account the same thing?  
b) either way, if she posts content to the community website, what - if any - content is automatically posted to her Fedivese account?  
c) is it possible for her to follow and take part in community conversations from her Fediverse app, without visiting the community website at all? If so, how is it possible?

#### ChatGPT:
Your questions delve into the integration of a Content Management System (CMS) and social media platforms within the Fediverse for your community website. Here's how these elements can work together:

a) **Fediverse Account for Community Website Access**:

- The integration between your community website and the Fediverse can be designed in two ways:
  1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Here, the community member uses her Fediverse account credentials to log in to your community website. While the accounts remain distinct (one for the Fediverse and one for your community site), the Fediverse account serves as the authentication method for your site. This approach simplifies the login process and ensures a seamless user experience.
  2. **Direct Integration**: In this scenario, the community member's Fediverse account and community site account are essentially the same. This means that when she creates an account on your community site, it is automatically linked and synchronized with her Fediverse account. This level of integration is more complex but provides a more unified experience.

b) **Posting Content from Community Website to Fediverse**:

- When a community member posts content on your website, the extent to which this content is shared on her Fediverse account can vary based on your site's settings and the preferences of the user. Options can include:
  - **Automatic Sharing**: Any content she posts (like articles, comments, or forum posts) is automatically shared on her Fediverse account.
  - **Selective Sharing**: The user has the option to select which content gets shared to her Fediverse account. This could be done through checkboxes or settings in the posting interface.
  - **Manual Sharing**: Users manually share content from your community site to their Fediverse account. This could be through a 'Share to Fediverse' button accompanying each piece of content.

c) **Following and Participating in Community Conversations via Fediverse App**:

- Yes, it's possible for a member to follow and participate in community conversations directly from her Fediverse app, depending on the level of integration between your CMS and the Fediverse platforms. This works through the ActivityPub protocol, which is a decentralized social networking protocol and the backbone of the Fediverse. Here’s how:
  - **Content Syndication**: Your CMS would use ActivityPub to syndicate content (such as forum posts or articles) to the Fediverse network. This allows the content to appear in the feeds of Fediverse users who follow your community's account or specific tags/topics.
  - **Interaction Capability**: Through ActivityPub, interactions like comments, likes, or shares made on the Fediverse can be reflected on your community site. This two-way interaction capability allows users to engage with community content without leaving their Fediverse app.
  - **Seamless Experience**: For the user, this integration means they can see updates, respond to discussions, and be part of the community directly through their existing Fediverse app, as the protocol bridges the gap between your site and the Fediverse platforms.

This integration offers a seamless and interconnected experience, enhancing the reach and engagement of your community while leveraging the decentralized nature of the Fediverse.
