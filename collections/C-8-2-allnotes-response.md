# Fediverse Community Building Strategies

This is C-8-2-allnotes-response, part of [[experiment 8]].

#### You:
I am interested in the possibilities offered by the "fediverse" - open, decentralised social media networks. I will give you some resources, I want you to suggest ways that organisations can use these networks to build online communities on their own websites, deeply interconnected with the wider Fediverse. 

Here are the resources: [[C-8-2-allnotes]]

#### ChatGPT:
To explore ways organizations can build online communities using decentralized social networks within the Fediverse, it's essential to consider the resources you provided. Here are some strategies and considerations based on these insights:

1. **Leverage Social Knowledge Graphs**: As mentioned in "Social knowledge graphs for collective intelligence," personalized social knowledge graphs can enhance the collective intelligence of a community. Organizations can develop systems where each member's personal knowledge graph is interconnected, creating a rich, collaborative network akin to wikis.

2. **Choose the Right Instance**: "Am I on the right Mastodon instance?" highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate server in the Fediverse. Organizations should choose or create an instance that aligns with their goals and culture, ensuring a suitable environment for their community.

3. **Address Sustainability Concerns**: The closure of the Mastodon instance in "All my toots gone" underscores the need for a sustainable business model. Organizations should consider funding models that ensure long-term viability, such as memberships, donations, or sponsorships.

4. **Facilitate Easy Transition and Interoperability**: As suggested in "How to Leave Dying Social Media Platforms," organizations should make it easy for users to transition from traditional social media to their platform, ensuring that links to friends and content are maintained.

5. **Promote Diverse and Inclusive Spaces**: To avoid echo chambers, as discussed in various articles, organizations should encourage diversity in their online communities. This involves fostering an environment where multiple viewpoints are respected and encouraged.

6. **Implement Effective Moderation**: The challenges of moderation in decentralized networks, as seen in "Decentralized Social Networks vs. The Trolls," mean organizations must establish clear codes of conduct and employ both automated and human moderation to maintain a healthy community.

7. **Explore New Technological Approaches**: Inspired by "Protocols, Not Platforms" and "Adversarial Interoperability," organizations can adopt innovative technological approaches that prioritize user control and data privacy, challenging the dominance of traditional social media platforms.

8. **Create 'Online Parks'**: Drawing from "To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online Parks," organizations can conceptualize their online spaces as digital public parks, fostering a sense of collective identity and responsible stewardship.

9. **Utilize ActivityPub**: As detailed in "What is ActivityPub, and how will it change the internet?", organizations should consider integrating ActivityPub into their platforms, allowing for cross-platform communication and decentralized content sharing.

10. **Encourage Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**: Based on insights from "Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs," organizations should facilitate knowledge sharing and collaborative projects, leveraging the collective intelligence of the community.

11. **Address Political and Social Polarization**: In light of the migration of certain groups to platforms like Parler (as in "How Some Conservatives Have Switched to Parler, Rumble and Newsmax"), organizations should be mindful of political and social polarization, striving to maintain balanced and respectful discourse.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can effectively harness the potential of the Fediverse to build vibrant, sustainable, and interconnected online communities on their own websites.


#### You:
I am particularly interested in ideas 8 and 9, as I don't want my website to be another Mastodon server or anything Twitter-like: these exist already. Instead, I want: users who have a Fediverse account to be able to contribute to my online community and follow its activity via their Fediverse account: and for my online community to be more of an "online park" - a safe, shared knowledgebase.  
  
Please write the website's "About this site" page, including several FAQs to guide new visitors towards joining. The website's online community should aim to build a shared knowledgebase about EU policies and activities in the specific area of promoting organic agriculture. The FAQs should explain why the users should join the community, how they can do so using their own Fediverse account, and how to follow the development of the community via their own Fediverse account.

#### You:
I want you to explore how points 4 (Content Management System (CMS)) and 9 (Social Media Integration with various Fediverse platforms) work together by answering the following questions:  
a) Imagine a community member who has a Fediverse account. Does she use her Fediverse account to create an account on my community website, or are her Fediverse account and her community account the same thing?  
b) either way, if she posts content to the community website, what - if any - content is automatically posted to her Fedivese account?  
c) is it possible for her to follow and take part in community conversations from her Fediverse app, without visiting the community website at all? If so, how is it possible?

#### ChatGPT:
Your questions delve into the integration of a Content Management System (CMS) and social media platforms within the Fediverse for your community website. Here's how these elements can work together:

a) **Fediverse Account for Community Website Access**:

- The integration between your community website and the Fediverse can be designed in two ways:
  1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Here, the community member uses her Fediverse account credentials to log in to your community website. While the accounts remain distinct (one for the Fediverse and one for your community site), the Fediverse account serves as the authentication method for your site. This approach simplifies the login process and ensures a seamless user experience.
  2. **Direct Integration**: In this scenario, the community member's Fediverse account and community site account are essentially the same. This means that when she creates an account on your community site, it is automatically linked and synchronized with her Fediverse account. This level of integration is more complex but provides a more unified experience.

b) **Posting Content from Community Website to Fediverse**:

- When a community member posts content on your website, the extent to which this content is shared on her Fediverse account can vary based on your site's settings and the preferences of the user. Options can include:
  - **Automatic Sharing**: Any content she posts (like articles, comments, or forum posts) is automatically shared on her Fediverse account.
  - **Selective Sharing**: The user has the option to select which content gets shared to her Fediverse account. This could be done through checkboxes or settings in the posting interface.
  - **Manual Sharing**: Users manually share content from your community site to their Fediverse account. This could be through a 'Share to Fediverse' button accompanying each piece of content.

c) **Following and Participating in Community Conversations via Fediverse App**:

- Yes, it's possible for a member to follow and participate in community conversations directly from her Fediverse app, depending on the level of integration between your CMS and the Fediverse platforms. This works through the ActivityPub protocol, which is a decentralized social networking protocol and the backbone of the Fediverse. Here’s how:
  - **Content Syndication**: Your CMS would use ActivityPub to syndicate content (such as forum posts or articles) to the Fediverse network. This allows the content to appear in the feeds of Fediverse users who follow your community's account or specific tags/topics.
  - **Interaction Capability**: Through ActivityPub, interactions like comments, likes, or shares made on the Fediverse can be reflected on your community site. This two-way interaction capability allows users to engage with community content without leaving their Fediverse app.
  - **Seamless Experience**: For the user, this integration means they can see updates, respond to discussions, and be part of the community directly through their existing Fediverse app, as the protocol bridges the gap between your site and the Fediverse platforms.

This integration offers a seamless and interconnected experience, enhancing the reach and engagement of your community while leveraging the decentralized nature of the Fediverse.
