1. **Originals | Hidden Brain : NPR**
   https://www.npr.org/2018/08/20/640216385/you-2-0-originals
   In his new book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, Adam investigates who comes up with great ideas, how, and what we can do to have more of them.... They often procrastinate, and that's how they incubate ideas.... Their parents focus more on values than rules... One of the risks is, you know, you have everybody marching in a different direction...They feel the same fears and doubts that the rest of us do. They just manage them differently. They hate taking risks. And they have lots of bad ideas, and that's how they get to the good ones....
   
   Originals are not the people with the deepest expertise. They're people with the broadest experience... really good at questioning the status quo... is a hallmark of being an original... 
   
   When they have an opportunity to dive head-first into something, take a big risk, they actually hedge their bets and hesitate.... the fear of failing gets overtaken by the fear of failing to try... shift from worrying about... making a fool of yourself to regretting never taking a chance.... in the long run our biggest regrets are our inactions - the chances we didn't take...
   
   They are drafted by other people... what makes them so effective ... they've spent months or years stewing on these ideas. And they've hatched by the time that somebody pulls them into the spotlight...
   
   Originality is brewing in all sorts of unexpected places... who are the people that, you know, are in a position to bring really new ideas into this organization. And why aren't we hearing from them? ... there's zero correlation between who's the best talker and who has the best ideas... what distinguishes the great from the ordinary is ... the great simply have many more ideas than the ordinary... failed the most because they're the ones who tried the most....
   
   A lot of us fall in love with our first ideas, and those are the most conventional... you have to weed out the familiar in order to get to the unusual. But a lot of people never get to those later ideas... it's just really hard to judge your own ideas.

2. **How To Train Your Brain To Be More Innovative**
   https://www.fastcompany.com/40405480/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-more-innovative
   Innovation is a series of steps, and that innovators possess certain characteristics... Almost everybody [has] innovative traits... the ability to think abstractly, having deep and broad knowledge, curiosity, openness to risk, grit, and dissatisfaction with the status quo... seek out experiences to put those traits to use

3. **IBM is ending its decades-old remote work policy**
   https://qz.com/924167/ibm-remote-work-pioneer-is-calling-thousands-of-employees-back-to-the-office/
   "Agile" describes so many different work systems that it’s become an almost meaningless term... for IBM "the leaders have to be with the squads [his word for small teams] and the squads have to be in a location."... Research suggests remote workers are more productive and log more hours than employees who work in the office, and for many companies, offering an option to work remotely helps recruit ... But IBM needs more than better productivity right now... the value of innovation ... trumps any productivity gain... working together in person is one key to innovation... the evolution of marketing into a practice that involves technology, data, and real-time responses warrants rethinking the workplace.

4. **The downside of diversity**
   http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/
   Robert Putnam -- famous for "Bowling Alone," ... found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects.... virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings... "Diversity... seems to bring out the turtle in all of us."... at odds with the vigor often associated with urban centers... there is a flip side to the discomfort diversity can cause... a big asset when it comes to driving productivity and innovation... the different ways of thinking among people from different cultures can be a boon... hanging out with people different than you, you're likely to get more insights. Diverse teams tend to be more productive.

5. **Giving Up Is the Enemy of Creativity**
   https://hbr.org/2015/12/giving-up-is-the-enemy-of-creativity
   What determines whether the ideas we generate are truly creative? Recent research of ours finds that one common factor often gets in the way: we tend to undervalue the benefits of persistence.

6. **Three Ways To Reframe A Problem To Find An Innovative Solution**
   http://www.fastcompany.com/3050265/hit-the-ground-running/three-ways-to-reframe-a-problem-to-find-innovative-solution
   First, some useful definitions: "Imagination is envisioning things that don’t exist... Creativity is applying imagination to address a challenge. Innovation is applying creativity to generate unique solutions. And entrepreneurship is applying innovations, scaling the ideas, by inspiring others’ imagination... the way to innovate is to look at situations from a fresh perspective... Reframing a problem helps you see it as an opportunity, and Seelig offers three techniques for finding innovative solutions...

7. **We'll Need Science Fiction To Imagine The Mind-Boggling Future Of War**
   http://io9.com/well-need-science-fiction-to-imagine-the-mind-boggling-1706010832
   "Nice way of bringing creatives in to think (ugh) out of the box - run a science fiction contest: "The Art Of Future Warfare ...is based on the idea that writers, artists and game designers have a lot to offer policy wonks... “Unconventional, imaginative thinking and expression can contribute meaningfully to the study and professional conduct of diplomacy, defense policy, and military operations... Experiencing how creatives think — as much as what they think — can demystify the creative process ... Writers, illustrators and filmmakers value process as much as content

 8 **Brainstorming Does Not Work (except when it does)**
   https://medium.com/galleys/brainstorming-does-not-work-6ad7b1448dcf
   While an excellent takedown of 'traditional' (group-focused) brainstorming techniques, this article should mention that individuals applying brainstorming techniques get good results. "In every case, four people working individually generated between 30 to 40 percent more ideas than four people working in a group. Their results were of a higher quality, too ... productivity decreases as group size increases... Research into brainstorming has a clear conclusion. The best way to create is to work alone and evaluate solutions as they occur. The worst way to create is to work in large groups and defer criticism... almost everybody has the idea that ideas are important... [but] Ideas are like seeds: they are abundant, and most of them never grow into anything... Having ideas is not the same thing as being creative. Creation is execution, not inspiration. Many people have ideas; few take the steps to make the thing they imagine.


9. **What I Wish I Knew About Creativity When I Was 20**
   https://open.bufferapp.com/creativity-advice/
   "Here's what I've come up with for advice to the 20-year-old version of me on being creative." Particularly like Neil Gaiman's advice: "A lot of times ideas will turn up when you're doing something else. And, most of all, ideas come from confluence - they come from two things flowing together...Which is why I-Labs is all about bringing people together from different parts of the company (and suppliers, and clients) to mix things up and see what happens.

10. **Ideation: List and Paint your Ideas**
    https://medium.com/@krystacurtis/paint-by-idea-81dcd2f5d34e
    Enjoying this excellent guide to ideation by Krysta Curtis. Something for the weekend: admit it, you won't have time for this much fun during the week...

11. **(Another) 4 Creativity Myths**
    http://www.fastcompany.com/3025319/work-smart/4-things-we-have-wrong-about-creativity
    Yet another list. My fave: "Geniuses produce a lot of crap before they get to the good stuff."

12. **Build a Culture of Innovation: Kill Mediocrity**
    http://weblog.mediatemple.net/tips/how-to-build-a-culture-of-innovation-by-killing-mediocrity-1
Easier said than done. It'd be a lot simpler if we could just Kill the Mediocre. "From startups to global enterprises I see two things. One, I've observed the voicing of ideas that immediately vanish into the ether of complacence, politics or blatant disregard. Two, I've witnessed the escape of morale where employees refuse to share ideas to improve or innovate or are uninspired to do so. In each condition, fervor wanes and mediocrity prevails. Weary spirits become a symptom of a diseased culture where hierarchy, process, and survival suffocate a democracy of ideas.

13. **The Discipline of Creativity**
   http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-discipline-of-creativity
   "Coming up with creative ideas on demand is only part of the answer. Just as crucial is how ideas link to action. ...we have developed an integrative process for idea generation based on approaches drawn education, consumer research, business model design, and emergent strategy... The first three steps are designed to help managers understand the problem deeply. Steps four through six describe how to generate tangible ideas for solutions. And the final step explains how to translate the ideas into action.

14. **"the idea that creative people are different from everyone else is a myth"**
    http://timkastelle.org/blog/2013/10/best-organisational-structure-creativity
    The company that invented Gore-Tex... "organised in small teams of 8-12 people.... three layers of management, the CEO, a handful of functional heads, and Associates … in a company of 8000!"
