	* v1: https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2zxlmj2dvub7smpul2lvwqfk/feed/brusselsbubble - created using https://blueskyfeedcreator.com:
		* simple search terms OR(Brussels, European Parliament, European Commission, #EU, MEPs, European Council, #ukraine, European Union)
		* language filter (en, fr)
		* result: very ukraine-heavy, didn't seem to pick up much of what on Twitter goes for "Brussels Bubble" content
