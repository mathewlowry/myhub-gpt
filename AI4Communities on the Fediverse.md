**This is a subfile of the primary [[AI4Communities post]], and won't make any sense unless you read its parent first. It explores how the AI4communities idea would look within the  ActivityPub-powered Fediverse**.

*(Notes: This is an early draft. As explained in [this newsletter edition](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/exploring-ai4communities-newsletter-6365b2716bb1), I am publishing these early versions as I develop my thoughts in the hope that constructive comments will help me finish the post. More version control in the footer.)*

My [manifesto posts of 1/1/23](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4) reflected *some* knowledge of the Fediverse, which I'd been tracking for a few years. My early versions of the [[AI4Communities post]], from which the following was extracted, reflected that bias. 

In fact, I'm not sure I would have come up with these ideas if ActivityPub hadn't shown that decentralised social media was at least possible. Moreover, the whole cozyweb idea reflects the Fediverse architecture - it's very easy to map "cozyweb community" <-> "Fediverse instance".

## Business models

In AI4Communities on the Fediverse, therefore:

* it's the community of users on a Fediverse instance that visits their “Friendly Neighborhood Algorithm Store” to choose some AI algorithms to support their community.  
* those algorithms must access the instance's content, of course, but as the community *owns* the AI there are no data issues. 
* the AIs are trained both by content and explicitly by its users

The store will provide an array of products and pricing schemes, including lower-cost subscription plans where the village's data, suitably anonymised, is used to affray the costs. Other villages may select higher-cost plans where the village does not share its data. Some may charge some or all members, and/or display ads.

The diversity of both funding schemes and AI plans means that one village may form a data union, while another sets up a for-profit instance and a third lets users choose between paying a subscription fee or seeing ads.

What I don't know, however:

* how effective will some of the AI services explored in  [[AI4Communities post]] be on the Fediverse? After all, a content discovery algorithm cannot discover content from an instance which isn't connected in some way to its home village
* how much protocol development would be required?
* is AI4communities a good cultural fit for the Fediverse?
