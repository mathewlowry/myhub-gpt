## Executive summary
### my version
*First, after doing the analysis manually, below, what I think.*

There was no clear "winner" - evaluated using 8 different parameters, each output had wins for some, losses for others. If I was looking for a first draft I could most efficiently edit into a newsletter, for example, the S-1-150 version was the closest in length and had all links integrated into its body, while the S-0 version highlighted the common themes a little more effectively, and AllNotes gave the least-worst title and article summaries of the least-wrong length.

But most, possibly all, of any efficiency gains from using ChatGPT to write this newsletter would be lost in the accuracy check. While checking the accuracy of each version's thoroughly would take more time than I have, every time I looked I found inaccurate hallucinations.

Those hallucinations, however, could be valuable if I wasn't trying to write a newsletter summarising 14 articles.

### ChatGPT's version
Then I asked ChatGPT's opinion: "*I will provide you an analysis of an experiment into the best way of using ChatGPT to create a newsletter summarising the content of 14 different articles, You will write an executive summary of the analysis of no longer than 400 words. Here is the original analysis, in markdown format:*"
