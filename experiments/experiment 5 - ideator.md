# Experiment 5: ideas from resources

**While I investigate visualisation options for finishing Experiment 4, I've decided to build on the results of [[experiment 1 - newsletter]].**

Status: *underway.*

Files:

* **Collection 5:** stuff I Hubbed week ending 2023-10-22: [[c-5_allnotes]]
* **Prompt**: [[prompt 5 - ideate]]
	* designed to reflect the recommend from Experiment 1: "Use ChatGPT outputs as idea generators rather than sources of literal truth"
	* I also included the requirement to follow the ideas with a newsletter-like summary as in [[Prompt 1 - newsletter]] . It didn't really do that, but when I asked it a 2nd time it included summary/links after each idea, a nice bonus.  
	* I also asked it for a newsletter summary without an editorial
* hence there are 2 **Responses**
	* [[c-5_allnotes-response-p5]]
	* [[c-5_allnotes-response-p1b]]
* **Analysis**: the 10 ideas in [[c-5_allnotes-response-p5]] are what I would call "cursory" in nature: a few lines combining some basic, superficial ideas from two resources to create a third along the lines of "combines the XXX capabilities of knowledge graphs with YYY's abilities to do ZZZ". None of them are exactly original: AI-enhanced writing, content validation or fact-checking, 1-2 personal assistants and image generation tools, a medical assistant. 
* Conclusion: It could simply be a numbers game, so worth trying again to see if something emerges from the next 10 resources, or the next 5.
