# Experiments 2 3 4 - text visualisers

Experiments 2 & 3 were early experiments into thematic analysis and visualisation performed only via the chatgpt/myhub integration pilot, before I had the experimental system worked out. I then made Experiment 4 by tweaking the collections and prompts from Experiment 3.

Note that all visualisations (so far) involve asking ChatGPT to give me mermaid code, which I then need to paste into mermaid.live. Building this feature direct into MyHub.ai would be pretty cool... but only if it's actually useful. Hence these experiments.

*Status*: Experiment 4 still underway.

## Experiment 2

* Collection 2: "the best stuff I like" https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=best&types=like&timeframe=anytime
* Summariser 0
	* AllNotes was too long for ChatGPT 
* Agent Prompt: [[prompt 2 - themes]]
* Response: [[C-2_s-0-response-p-2]]
## Experiment 3

* Collection 3: "the best stuff tagged psychology and disinformation" https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=disinformation&types=like&timeframe=anytime&quality=best&tags=psychology 
* Summariser 0
* Agent Prompt: [[prompt 2 - themes]]
* Response: [[c-3_s-0-response-p-2]]

## Experiment 4: C-3-S-1-150-P-2b/c

Aiming for a different style of visualisation - concept map, rather than mindmap - resulting in a new visualisation tool:

* Collection 3: "the best stuff tagged psychology and disinformation" https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=disinformation&types=like&timeframe=anytime&quality=best&tags=psychology 
* AllNotes: [[c-3_allnotes]]
* Summariser 1 [[c-3_s-1-150]]
* Agent Prompts: 
	* [[prompt 2b - themes visualised]]
	* [[prompt 2c - themes and resources visualised]]
* Responses: 
	* [[c-3_allnotes-response-p-2b-1]]
	* [[c-3_allnotes-response-p-2b-2]] (same prompt, entirely different thematic analysis from ChatGPT)
	* [[c-3_allnotes-response-p-2c-a]] using prompt 2c, version 1
	* this lead to [[c-3_allnotes-response-p-2c-b]]: applying prompt 2c, version 2, tested on the same collection
