## Experiment 5 
While I investigate visualisation options for finishing Experiment 4, I've decided to build on the results of Experiment 1 to create a weekly newsletter:

* C-5-S-0-P-5
* Collection 5: stuff I Hubbed week ending 2023-10-22: [[C-5-AllNotes]]
* Prompt: [[Prompt 5 - Ideas from recent articles]]
	* designed to reflect the recommend from Experiment 1: "Use ChatGPT outputs as idea generators rather than sources of literal truth"
	* I also included the requirement to follow the ideas with a newsletter-like summary as in [[Prompt 1 - newsletter A]] . It didn't really do that, but when I did ask it a 2nd time it included summary/links after each idea, which was a nice bonus.   
	* I also asked it for a newsletter summary without an editorial
