# Experiment 5

**While I investigate visualisation options for finishing Experiment 4, I've decided to build on the results of [[experiment 1]].**

Status: *underway.*

Files:

* Collection 5: stuff I Hubbed week ending 2023-10-22: [[c-5-allnotes]]
* Prompt: [[prompt 5 - ideas from recent articles]]
	* designed to reflect the recommend from Experiment 1: "Use ChatGPT outputs as idea generators rather than sources of literal truth"
	* I also included the requirement to follow the ideas with a newsletter-like summary as in [[prompt 1 - newsletter a]] . It didn't really do that, but when I did ask it a 2nd time it included summary/links after each idea, which was a nice bonus.   
	* I also asked it for a newsletter summary without an editorial
