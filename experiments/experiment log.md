# Experiment log 

(and the occasional newsletter or blog post published elsewhere)

* foretaste: should I develop [[NetflixThis GPT]]?
* [[experiment 10]]: throwing most of the prompts developed below at a small collection of recent resources about AI (see also: [ChatGPT integration free trial, Bullshit, Botshit and Bubbles (newsletter 3)](https://myhub.ai/items/chatgpt-integration-free-trial-bullshit-botshit-and-bubbles-newsletter-3))
* [[experiment 9]]: riffing off yet another excerpt from the LinkedIn chat, this time on the opportunities missed, and perhaps becoming available again, from on-site communities and newsletters (see also: [EU Converge - Bridging Communities for Inclusive Policy (a ChatGPT proposal)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-converge-bridging-communities-inclusive-policy-chatgpt-lowry-igfve/))
* [[experiment 8]]: riffing off another excerpt from the LinkedIn chat, this time on alternative social media and their implications for communication strategies. 
* [[experiment 7]]: riffing off a 2m excerpt from a LinkedIn chat I had on integrating internal and external communication strategies, knowledge management and more. 
* [[experiment 6 - ideator GPT]]: trying to reproduce something like Experiment 5, but with (my first) GPT (see also: [The Dual Faces of AI Chatbots in Social Media (according to my GPT)](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/the-dual-faces-of-ai-chatbots-in-social-media-according-to-my-gpt-4820d37d4d3d)) 
* [[experiment 5 - ideator]]: reflects the recommendation ChatGPT itself gave me in Experiment 1: *"Use ChatGPT outputs as idea generators rather than sources of literal truth"*
* [[experiments 2 3 4 - knowledge visualisation]]: help me visualise what this collection of resources is about (see also: [Visualising knowledge with MyHub.ai and ChatGPT (newsletter 2)](https://myhub.ai/items/myhub-chatgpt-integration-visualising-knowledge-newsletter-2-december-2023))
* [[experiment 1 - newsletter]]: write me a newsletter about a collection of resources (see also: [MyHub-ChatGPT integration (newsletter 1)](https://myhub.ai/items/myhub-chatgpt-integration-newsletter-october-2023))
