# Overview: Fediverse

*(Notes: This is a permanent version of my [Fediverse Overview](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/overview/16/?quality=all&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime). More version control information in the footer.)*

## What?

Fediverse: collection of interoperable social networks built on Open Web standards. ActivityPub standard, for example, is used by (inter alia) Twitter-lookalike Mastodon and YouTube-lookalike PeerTube, and sometime in 2024 newcomers Bluesky and Threads (tbc!).

Unlike Twitter and YouTube, however:

- Mastodon/PeerTube are not owned and controlled by corporations. Anyone can launch and operate a Mastodon or PeerTube server, just like anyone can set up an email server and exchange emails with others using the email standard.
- The person who creates a server sets its rules (privacy, hate speech, etc).
- Users on any Mastodon/PeerTube server can not only interact with users on other Mastodon/PeerTube servers, they can interact _across Fediverse platforms._ For example:
    - if Mastodon user A follows PeerTube user B, B’s PeerTube videos will appear in A’s Mastodon feed,
    - user A can even comment on the video _from within Mastodon,_ without visiting PeerTube or having a PeerTube account.

This would be like if my Twitter account followed someone's Facebook page, yet we could still interact seamlessly from our platform of preference. That’s impossible as Twitter & Facebook are walled gardens. Fediverse platforms like Mastodon and PeerTube are not – this is the Open Web on social.

**See also**: [Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/), providing social media users with control over their data through personal knowledge graphs.

### So what? New possibilities for new social platforms

While each Fediverse server is a community with its own rules, they're _not_ walled gardens. This helps solve the vicious circle problem facing new platforms (_why join a network where there are so few people on it? Hence noone joins it, so numbers stay low. So noone joins it_): people don’t need to join the _same_ social network, they just have to join _any_ Fediverse network. 

**Reality check**: Servers must be bidirectionally linked manually? Mastodon apparently suffers from "_the singleton problem... [as it's] difficult to convince ... a major server to [federate] ... with a minor one... three Mastodon servers contain almost 60% of the known Mastodon population_" - [Peer-to-Peer Network Models and their Implications](https://backdrifting.net/post/042_p2p_models).

**See also**: [adversarial interoperability](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=adversarial+interoperability) - another part of the solution to this problem.

### Let's do better

**If progressives decamp, they should decamp to Fediverse alternatives.**

The EU Institutions could help: by simply joining and posting to Fediverse platforms in addition to Facebook/Twitter, they could:

- encourage the emergence of alternatives to today’s toxic US platforms,
- add a new dimension to the EU's strategy towards them.

## Return of the Splinternet?

Nevertheless, wide Fediverse adoption _still_ requires a 'mass decamp'. There have already been a couple of false dawns.

### US2020

Cue the US2020 elections, following which "[US conservative leaders may have triggered the sort an en masse decamp that Facebook/Twitter alternatives require to take off](https://myhub.ai/items/how-some-conservatives-have-switched-to-parler-rumble-and-newsmax-the-new-york-times)".

However they're _not_ moving to Fediverse platforms, so this may simply return us to the #splinternet (pre-platform social media), but with even more political polarisation.

### _2022 update:_ Elon Musk and the #TwitterMigration

Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter triggered a huge uptick of interest in Mastodon, leading me to finally take the plunge after 2 years of faffing about. I was optimistic (my first post was _literally_ [Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob)](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/welcome-to-the-fediverse-starry-eyed-noob-twittermigration-day-3-57b99350414), but within a few months I'd discovered an unhappy truth: the current infrasructure simply doesn't deliver content properly reliably.

I'd point you to the mid-2022 toot where I pointed this out, but (as if to illustrate my point) it's gone: in November my server simply disappeared, taking all my content and connections with it, without warning. I managed to dig out a screenshot of that toot from my phone and include it in [All my toots gone](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/all-my-toots-gone-e844f7c5f255).

As can be seen from that post, by then I'd created a Bluesky account and was promptly followed by Satan. I haven't bothered since.

Also in 2022: just [as I was writing a Fediverse strategy report for another EC department](https://campaign.openworlds.info/@mathew/109270237442798710), the EU's Data Protection Supervisor and the EC's IT department launched [social.network.europa.eu](https://social.network.europa.eu/explore), the EU's own Mastodon server. The result was underwhelming to say the least, with accounts limited to the institutions, rather than the people working in them. Someone clearly never read [Euan Semple](https://euansemple.blog/)'s "Organisations don't tweet, people do", missing a huge opportunity that news organisations started embracing in 2022: setting up a Fediverse server for their journalists to prove that they _are_ their journalists, not an imposter.

Soon afterwards the EU Bubble's own server - [https://eupolicy.social/](https://eupolicy.social/about) - was launched. As I pointed out at the time, this had real potential:

> it should be very easy for eupolicy.social to avoid creating a Brussels Bubble within the Fediverse. In the past I spent a lot of time exploring how us denizens of the Brussels Bubble could _outreach_ to national conversations online. In the Fediverse, that’s upside down: rather than building bridges outwards, we can _pull national conversations into the Bubble,_ simply by following the right people.  
> -[Am I on the right Mastodon instance?](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/am-i-on-the-right-mastodon-instance-a0aee14ca00f) (November 2022)

Back then they had 720 active accounts. 13 months later that had shrunk to 330. The EU's [social.network.europa.eu](https://social.network.europa.eu/explore) has 18. It wasn't a good year.

## Threads, Bluesky, and more

Literally one month after my Mastodon server disappeared, Instagram's "Twitter-killer" Threads arrived in Europe, announcing their intention - like Bluesky - to [join the Fediverse](https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C046LSmPAuN), so I dug out my never-used Instagram account to kick the tyres.

As discussed during [a ZNLive chat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140976711302545408/) one week before, this should make 2024 at least potentially _interesting:_

- so far they should all use the same slogan: "We're like Twitter, but with none of your friends", so it's difficult to see people and organisations who rely on reaching an audience abandoning the incumbents anytime soon
- the hope is that their openness (if it happens) stimulates innovation in the wider Fediverse, so we get new forms of social media rather than more Twitter clones: there are already plenty of other ActivityPub-compatible networks, as well as alternative protocols like [Nostr](https://nostr.com/).
- all this could have huge implications for our own websites, where it might become both easier and more valuable to develop local communities of interest, networked into the wider Fediverse of decentralised social media, particularly with AI support.
