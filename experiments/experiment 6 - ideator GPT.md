# Experiment 6: my first GPT

On 2023-11-10 I (finally!) got access to create my own GPTs, and after a bit of trial and error created my first: [[idea weaver gpt]]. I decided to replicate [[experiment 5 - ideator]] using it and a (slightly) different Collection. 

Status: *underway.*

Files:

* **Collection 6**: 
	* URL: [all the stuff I had Hubbed in the current month ***by 2023-11-10***](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=this_month) , but note that the content of the Collection at this link will vary over time...
	* and in any case I had to export the RSS to send it to Idea Weaver, so the actual Collection used is [[c-6-myhub-thismonth-2023-11-10.txt]] 
* **prompt**: [[idea weaver gpt]]
* **responses**: 
	* [[Experiment 6 - response 1]], 
		* [[Experiment 6 Idea Weaver response part 2 - images]] 
	* extract published as blog post: [The Dual Faces of AI Chatbots in Social Media (according to my GPT)](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/the-dual-faces-of-ai-chatbots-in-social-media-according-to-my-gpt-4820d37d4d3d)
* **analysis**:  
	* *full analysis to be done*
