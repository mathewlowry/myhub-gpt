In this experiment I'm going to try and combine techniques developed in as many of the previous ones as possible, using the same content:

* Collection 10: [the stuff i like this year](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&types=like&timeframe=this_year) - just 5 resources, as of 2024-01-09.
* Process: I threw the best part of my kitchen sink at this one, just to see what would happen:
	* first, [[Prompt 1 - newsletter]], creating a perfectly adequate summary
	* then, [[prompt 2c - themes and resources visualised]] to generate some visualisations of the themes running through these articles, creating [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap1.jpeg]]
	* this led to a new approach, focusing on the topic of open source AI and using elements of [[prompt 2e - framework]], creating [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap3.jpeg]]
	* 2 versions were created of a blog post - the second was extracted: [[C-10-S-0-response-extract1-blogpost]]
	* I then challenged ChatGPT's bullshit about how Ai creates bullshit, and it rather meekly agreed: "*The fact that the URL provided is fabricated emphasizes the importance of ensuring the reliability of AI-generated information. It raises concerns about the potential for chatbots or AI models to generate persuasive yet unsubstantiated text*"
* Full response: [[C-10-S-0-response]]
