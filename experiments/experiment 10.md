In this experiment I'm going to try and combine techniques developed in as many of the previous ones as possible, using the same content:

* Collection 10: [the stuff i like this year](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&types=like&timeframe=this_year) - just 5 resources, as of 2024-01-09.
* Process: I threw the best part of my kitchen sink at this one, just to see what would happen:
	* first, [[Prompt 1 - newsletter]], creating a perfectly adequate summary
	* then, [[prompt 2c - themes and resources visualised]] to generate some visualisations of the themes running through these articles, creating [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap1.jpeg]]
	* this led to a new approach, focusing on the topic of open source AI and using elements of [[prompt 2e - framework]], creating [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap3.jpeg]]
	* 2 versions were created of a blog post. For the second I asked for "*greater depth, using quotes from all relevant articles wherever relevant, and ensuring each reference to an article is linked to its URL.*"
	* I then challenged ChatGPT's bullshit about how AI creates bullshit, and it rather meekly agreed: "*The fact that the URL provided is fabricated emphasizes the importance of ensuring the reliability of AI-generated information. It raises concerns about the potential for chatbots or AI models to generate persuasive yet unsubstantiated text*"
* Full response: [[C-10-S-0-response]], from which I have extracted:
	* newsletter: [[C-10-S-0-extract-newsletter]]
	* resource & theme visualisations: 
		* drafts: [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap1.jpeg]], [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap2.jpeg]] 
		* final: [[C-10-S-0-response-conceptmap3.jpeg]]
	* blog posts: 
		* draft: [[C-10-S-0-response-extract-blogpost-1]]
		* [[C-10-S-0-response-extract-blogpost 2]]
* Analyses:
	* the newsletter was boring, wooden and repetitive - it didn't even try, for example, to play the two articles on "bullshit" together. I should have pushed back and asked for better, but the main goal was for me to get an overview of the articles to inform the next stage (visualisations). 
	* visualisations: there was an improvement from 1 to 3, but frankly the underlying analysis was insufficiently insightful for these to be of much use
	* comparing the blog posts: the second was an improvement textually, but it made up URLs, despite having them in its memory (unless they'd passed out the token window?)
