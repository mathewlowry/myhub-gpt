# Pilot MyHub-ChatGPT integration
**How the pilot integration currently works.**

When I'm logged in I see the following form at https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/chat.

Using this form I can:
- paste into Context URLs the URL of a MyHub Collection - eg [All the Stuff I Like about Everything tagged #creativity & #innovation, Anytime](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=creativity&types=like&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=innovation). This defines the **Collection** of notes I want to chat with ChatGPT about
- optionally, include a search term in Search within context query to narrow down the content further
- Write a prompt to start the conversation with ChatGPT, including the content wherever I want to discuss by clicking the "insert content placeholder" button.
