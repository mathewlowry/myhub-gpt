# Experiment 6 analysis

Analysis of [[experiment 6 - ideator GPT]], notably [[Experiment 6 - response]] & [[Experiment 6 Idea Weaver images]].

## Introduction

### Goals

Figure out:

* how best to extract interesting, idea-provoking ideas from a collection of resources (as in [[experiment 5 - ideator]])
* but use a GPT for the job: [[idea weaver gpt]]

### Process

* Create a collection
* create an RSS file from it
* Create a GPT: 
	* upload the RSS, teach it how to remove all the junk (reusing [[rss to clean notes prompt]]), 
	*  launch a conversation with [[prompt 5 - ideate]] 
*  this created 6 different themes, explored in conversation with the GPT 
* at one point I asked for 
	* a blog post: https://mathewlowry.medium.com/the-dual-faces-of-ai-chatbots-in-social-media-according-to-my-gpt-4820d37d4d3d
	* a series of images to illustrate it:  [[Experiment 6 Idea Weaver images]].

## Identifying ideas

The GPT is supposed to "Focuses on finding contradictions, similar ideas in different contexts, or similar conclusions in varying contexts" from amongst the collection of resources provided. The idea is to provoke ideas for further development. How did it do?

## Developing ideas

I asked it to explore two ideas, one of which lead (for the simple hell of it) to a blog post.
