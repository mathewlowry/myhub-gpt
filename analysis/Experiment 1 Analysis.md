# MyHub/GPT integration - experiment 1 (newsletter)

**The first results from my series of experiments to identify the most valuable MyHub Agent prompts are promising and confusing in equal measure.**

As explained in [[Introduction]] I'm sharing the results of my research into integrating MyHub.ai with an LLM as they happen. 

## Experiment 1 (C-1-S-1-150-P-1) 

See [[ChatGPT Experiment log#^56fa46]] for all files, the three outputs to compare are:

- [[C-1-AllNotes-response-P-1]]: what ChatGPT returns when sent the entirety of the contents of the 14 Hubbed notes in Collection 1 ("[All the Stuff I Like about Everything tagged #creativity & #innovation, Anytime](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=creativity&types=like&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=innovation)") and asked [[Prompt 1 - newsletter A]] (500 word editorial summarising the main themes & brief summaries of each article)
- [[C-1-S-0-response-P-1.md]]: what ChatGPT returns when sent "Summariser 0" summaries of the posts in Collection 1, with Prompt 1
- [[C-1-S-1-150-response-P-1.md]]: what ChatGPT returns when sent "Summariser 1" summaries, set to a maximum length of 150 words, of the posts in Collection 1, with Prompt 1.

## Remark on the Collection

As you can see if you check out the original Collection and the input files, for many Notes there wasn't a huge difference between the AllNotes and S-150 files sent to ChatGPT.

That's due to the way I've changed how I Hub resources, creating notes. For many years many of my Hubbed notes were more like bookmarks, providing a quick summary of why I thought a resource was worth reading, but not summarising what I learnt from it. It was only a few years ago, after reading [Sonke Ahren's "How to write smart notes"](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/de/takesmartnotes), that I more consistently spent more time summarising in my own words what I found valuable in the resources I Hubbed ([example](https://myhub.ai/items/ai-is-life)).

## First analyses

Sent the same prompt [[Prompt 1 - newsletter A]], the differences between ChatGPT's proposed newsletters is striking.
