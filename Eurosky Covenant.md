Apart from being a legal document covering the use of CoCoMo, it also includes value statements. In this way funding organisations can be sure the projects they support through us meet their values.

This, however, means that there needs to be a governance process. Governance should cover:

- who decides what the covenant says?
- how is it maintained and evolved?
- how do we deal with companies not respecting the covenant? Obviously at the end of the day this will be a legal discussion, but it might be worth having processes which can avoid that in as many cases as possible.
