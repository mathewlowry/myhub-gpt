# Ideas log

**Ideas to explore in future experiments, possible features for MyHub.ai, blog posts which could be written and anything else I feel like jotting down.**

* Features to explore
	* Custom Summarisers: each Note is summarised using a summariser chosen from a library based on the tags the resource has
	* transparency in publishing content with AI support 
		* content published with a "% AI-generated" score
		* content published linked to the AI conversation(s) which underpinned it 
	* pooling and sharing prompts
	* image generation prompts
* To explore experimentally: 
	* Asking twice: does asking twice get better results? See [[Experiment 1 analyses]]
	* Build [[NetflixThis GPT]]
* Blog post ideas
	* [[AI4Communities post]]
	* [[blowing hot and cold about AI]]
	* 
	* reversion to the mean 
		* cf [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/analytics/post-summary/urn:li:activity:7122652868104314881/)
		* [However, while using AI "produce ideas of higher quality... there is a marked reduction in the variability ... [and so] might lead to more homogenized outputs."](https://myhub.ai/items/navigating-the-jagged-technological-frontier-field-experimental-evidence-of-the-effects-of-ai-on-knowledge-worker-productivity-and-quality)
	* on AI-generated knowledge visualisations: "If [Charts can lie](https://albertocairo.com/), ChatGPT visualisations are **magician-level misleading**" - [[experiments 2 3 4 _ analysis]]
	* explore the pros, cons and how of integrating emotional stimuli into GPTs (see [[experiment 6 analysis]])
		* first come up with my own ideas, then see what GPT manages
