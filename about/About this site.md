This site is a massive wiki, which essentially means it's:

* my notes (in this case on my experiments with integrating MyHub.ai with Large Language Models), stored and edited on my PCs in markdown format
* synched to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/mathewlowry/myhub-gpt
* and from there published to [experiments.myhub.ai](https://experiments.myhub.ai/) by the[ MassiveWiki publishing kit](https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massive-wiki-publishing-kit) 

How is this different from any other site? It means that (if you wish), you can [Clone the Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) , which:

* downloads a copy onto your PC of all my experimental notes - the collections, prompts, summarisers, responses and analyses - where you can browse then just as easily as you can online, but also *add your own*
* allows you to download any updates made to them in the future with a click of a button
* and even allows you to contribute your own... in theory (I haven't decided whether I'll open this up to contributions yet, but I [have activated Discussions](https://github.com/mathewlowry/myhub-gpt/discussions) on the GitHub repository, so let me know if you'd like to collaborate).

It's pretty cool and totally open-source tech, and allows any group to share and collaborate using whatever editor they want (markdown is a common standard) and share their results with the rest of the world. 

This is my second massive wiki - I made a short video about the first: [Why I'm massively into massive.wiki (and why you should be too)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfYl3SiZJWU).

You will need to install Git on your machine (it's easy!) and have an markdown editor app. The latter will allow you to both browse these files like they're a website on your personal machine, and edit them. If this is new to you, I'd start with my markdown editor of choice: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
