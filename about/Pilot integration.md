# Pilot MyHub-ChatGPT integration
**How the pilot integration currently works.**

The following is briefly explained in the first ~1m40 of [MyHub.ai & ChatGPT: early adopter preview, October 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PykfgbRwZiY) (video).

When I'm logged in I see the following form at (*my hub's address*/chat).
![[myhub-chatgpt-pilot-form.png]]

Using this form I can:

- paste into Context URLs the URL of a MyHub Collection - eg [All the Stuff I Like about Everything tagged #creativity & #innovation, Anytime](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=creativity&types=like&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=innovation). This defines the **Collection** of notes I want to chat with ChatGPT about
- optionally, include a search term in Search within context query to narrow down the content further
- write a prompt to start the conversation with ChatGPT, and include the Collection wherever I want by positioning the cursor in the appropriate spot and clicking the "insert content placeholder" button.

I can thus have a conversation with ChatGPT about any collection of content n my personal Hub.

However, as the rest of the above video points out, this is just the start - see [[chatgpt integration plans]].
