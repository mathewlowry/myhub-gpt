# A Brave, early inspiration

**This is a subfile of the primary [[AI4Communities post]], and won't make any sense unless you read its parent first. It explores how the AI4communities idea would look within the  ActivityPub-powered Fediverse**.

In May 2023 Brave Software, creators of the privacy-first eponymous browser and search engine, released [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/ai/using-brave-search-api). Via this service, AI developers can access the training dataset Brave developed through both Brave Search and their [Web Discovery Project](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project), which allows Brave browser users to contribute anonymous data about the pages they’re actually visiting.

As a result, Brave’s training data “_is much more representative of the Web people actually care about_”, without the huge morass of “_junk sites — spam, dead links, duplicates, and more_” one finds when crawling the Web at large. And that was written _before_ the Web started filling up with AI-generated content, which is even worse for training AI.
