## General FAQs

### Where can I learn more about ATproto?

### What is the scope of atproto.science?

We interpret science broadly — not just traditional academic research, but any form of systematic inquiry, including work by citizen scientists, independent researchers, and self-defined scholars. We're exploring a range of approaches to building this inclusive research ecosystem on ATProto:

- New kinds of science publishing and communication tools (such as Nanopublications or Discourse Graphs)
- ATProto lexicon design for scholarly activity
- Social apps for research communities
- Discovery and curation through better research feeds
- AI applications for scientific work
- ATProto integrations for tools for thought like Obsidian, Notion or Roam.
- Decentralized infrastructure for hosting science data and services

This is an evolving space, and we're actively learning from the community about what tools and services would be most valuable for research on Bluesky/ATProto. Please join the discussion!

### Where is the discussion?

Apart from at our [[events]], we:

* hang out on Bluesky - check out the atproto.science Starter Pack, and the custom feeds we're developing there
* have more indepth discussions on [this ATproto Discourse thread](https://discourse.atprotocol.community/t/intros-and-kickoff-thread-for-atproto-x-science/156/3?u=mathewlowry.bsky.social)
