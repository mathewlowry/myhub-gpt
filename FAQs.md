## Is science into Bluesky? Why?

The science sector has been such a "Bluesky early adopter" that it's become a subject of scientific study itself - see: 

* [Bluesky & Science](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:lf4a2b6djtuv5l3lz7ffsyv4/post/3lrupgx4bws27)(*Altmetric*, June 2025)
* [Are there stars in Bluesky? A comparative exploratory analysis of altmetric mentions between X and Bluesky](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157725000641) (*ScienceDirect*, June 2025)
* [Research posts on Bluesky are more original — and get better engagement](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02741-1) (*Nature*, August 2025)
* [As academic Bluesky grows, researchers find strengths—and shortcomings](https://www.science.org/content/article/academic-bluesky-grows-researchers-find-strengths-and-shortcomings) (*Science*, January 2025)

Some of the most popular Custom Feeds are also science-oriented. But why this particular interest? 

Everyone here has their own theory, but the flood of scientists leaving X for Mastodon and Bluesky only started when Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and sacked thousands of employees, many in content moderation jobs. The resulting surge in misinformation, trolls, bots and hate speech was never going to suit people who have been trained professionally to only publish content they can back up with evidence (btw, did we mention that [Media loves Bluesky, too?](https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-29-2024-engagement)).

Once scientists started joining Bluesky, and particularly once troll-free, science-oriented Custom feeds emerged, the more valuable it became for more scientists to join Bluesky, triggering a virtuous cycle.

## What is the scope of atproto.science?

We use the term "science" broadly — not just traditional academic research, but any form of systematic inquiry, including work by citizen scientists, independent researchers, and self-defined scholars. 

We're exploring a range of approaches to building an inclusive research ecosystem on ATProto:

- New kinds of science publishing and communication tools (such as Nanopublications or Discourse Graphs)
- ATProto lexicon design for scholarly activity
- Social apps for research communities
- Discovery and curation through better research feeds
- AI applications for scientific work
- ATProto integrations for tools for thought like Obsidian, Notion or Roam.
- Decentralized infrastructure for hosting science data and services
- Tools to help scientific institutions make the most out of ATproto.

This is an evolving space, so the above is just a starting point. Our first goal is simply to bring everyone together to explore the tools and services of most value for researchers on ATProto, and then map a path to building them. 

## Where are you discussing this?

Apart from at our [[events]], we:

* hang out on Bluesky - check out the atproto.science Starter Pack, and the custom feeds we're developing there
* have more indepth discussions on [this ATproto Discourse thread](https://discourse.atprotocol.community/t/intros-and-kickoff-thread-for-atproto-x-science/156/3?u=mathewlowry.bsky.social)

## How can I contact you?

Apart from engaging with the community on Bluesky and Discourse (above), you can reach out to the organisers directly at [hello@atproto.science](mailto:hello@atproto.science)
