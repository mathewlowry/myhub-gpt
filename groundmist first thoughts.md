#groundmist

This note takes as background [How putting myhub.ai on the ATmosphere will help decentralised collective intelligence](https://whtwnd.com/mathewlowry.bsky.social/3lmymts4xu42k), which I originally wanted to discuss at Ahoy25 in Hamburg but retracted as Boris had a similar idea but at a more general (and so useful imo) level.

In the run up to Ahoy Boris pointed me to Groundmist, and in the aftermath I read the 3 posts ([my notes are on my Hub](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=groundmist)). So now I:

* would like to ensure I understand this right
* and if I do, have a few questions 

## Did I get this right?

With Groundmist:

* We can have a local app that manages content stored locally on a Personal Synch Server
* This content can be organised using a variety of lexicons
* Using the app to set a property of some content to "publish" sends (copies?) of the content to the PDS, from where it is published onto the appropriate appview, depending on the lexicon

## So could we have...

So could the app:

* have an **Inbox** which 
	* is a bluesky client, so the user has bluesky integrated into the app
	* reads RSS, so the user can follow many other information sources
	* maybe even reads email, so the user can have the content of the newsletters they subscribe to straight in the app
* allow the user to grab some content from the above feeds and add it to their PSS?
* have a tool4thought built in, and/or could the PSS be readable/editable by a  tool4thought (Obsidian, etc.)?

## Of CMSs and Lexicons
One of the places PDS content is published in the above picture is "Personal site". This is a large category - there are blogs, newsletter sites, digital gardens, etc. 

So:

* Where are the CMSs in this picture? I get that these sites pull their data from the PDS, but where is the software (Jekyll, Drupal) that organises it online?
* Will each type of site need a different lexicon? Most sites need multiple content types, so does that mean multiple lexicons *per site*?
