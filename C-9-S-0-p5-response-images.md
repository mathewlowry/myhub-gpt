### You:
I need a number of graphics to help illustrate a project. It is run by the European Union, so the EU flag will need to be part of it. The project is called "EU Converge: Bridging Communities for Inclusive Policy", and aims to bridge communities, promote intellectual empathy, and actively involve diverse individuals in shaping EU policies and decisions. It seeks to foster dialogue, understanding, and collaboration among citizens from diverse backgrounds, with a focus on a specific EU subject area. It integrates physical events and online spaces via an online community within a thematic portal, integrating social media through a Collaborative Blogging Network. 

Please design me four proposals for the project logo

### You:
Good. Now give me a poster design. The poster should not have any text - no text at all. It will be used to promote a physical project event: one of the "Converge Conference Series". These conferences are both physical event and virtual experience, and are focused on the selected EU subject area. The conferences aim to bring together experts, stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens in an inclusive environment. Through panel discussions, interactive workshops, and collaborative activities, participants can exchange ideas, share perspectives, and collectively work on policy recommendations as they develop a shared database of knowledge.
