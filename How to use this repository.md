# How to use this repository

## Know GitHub?
If you're familiar with GitHub, then you already know that all you need to do is clone the repository and open it with any markdown editor, getting my experimental notes - the collections, prompts, summarisers, responses and analyses - onto your machine, where you can browse it easily and easily synch any updates I push to the repo. 

I haven't decided whether I'll open this up to contributions yet, but I [have activated Discussions](https://github.com/mathewlowry/myhub-gpt/discussions) so let me know if you'd like to collaborate.

## New to GitHub?
If you're not familiar with GitHub you have three options:
### Read this repository on GitHub
This is what you're probably doing right now. 

The problem is that the links from one file to another don't work, so when you see a link like [[Experiment 1 Analysis]] you'll have to browse the folders looking for the file "Experiment 1 Analysis.md" (".md" because these are markdown files - see "Clone the repository", below).

### Download this repository and browse it
The good news:
* You can download a copy of this repository's contents onto your personal machine simply by clicking on "Code", above, and selecting "Download ZIP".
* apart from a few images, all files are in markdown format - like the HTML files powering the Web, but simpler. So you'll need to get any markdown editor: 
	* Why bother? In markdown, [[Experiment 1 Analysis]] actually links to the file "Experiment 1 Analysis.md", so with your markdown editor you can browse these files like they're a website on your personal machine. 
	* If this is new to you, I'd start with my markdown editor of choice: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

The bad news:  when I upload new content you won't hear about it, and will have to download everything again.

### Clone the repository 
If you feel like learning something useful, read [Clone a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  This process not only downloads a copy of this repository's contents onto your personal machine, it then allows you to download any update made to them in the future, and even contribute your own. 

You will, however, need to install Git on your machine (it's easy!), as well as any markdown editor (see above).
