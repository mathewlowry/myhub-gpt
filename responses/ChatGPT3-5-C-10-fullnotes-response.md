   URL: [https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/blog/afb21/oops-we-automated-bullshit](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/blog/afb21/oops-we-automated-bullshit)
   According to:

   - MIT Professor of AI Rodney Brooks, ChatGPT "“just makes up stuff that sounds good"... where “sounds good” is an algorithm to imitate text found on the internet, while “makes up” is the basic randomness of relying on predictive text rather than logic or facts",
   - Geoff Hinton: "the greatest risks is not that chatbots will become super-intelligent, but that they will generate text that is super-persuasive without being intelligent, in the manner of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson",
   - Harry Frankfurt "explains that the bullshitter “does not reject the authority of truth, as the liar does […] He pays no attention to it ... bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are”",
   - Graeber’s famous analysis of Bullshit Jobs ... revealed that over 30% of British workers believe their own job contributes nothing of any value to society... writing pointless reports, relaying messages from one person to another, or listening to complaints they can do nothing about... [all] easily done by ChatGPT... we train people for bullshit jobs by training them to generate bullshit.

3. What kind of bubble is AI?

   "All economic bubbles are hugely destructive, but some ... leave behind (useful) wreckage that can be salvaged":

   - the first dotcom bubble left behind "cheap servers, office furniture and space... a generation of young people ,,, trained as web makers... technologists from non-technical backgrounds"
   - crypto bubble: "a smattering of Rust programmers... bad digital art and worse Austrian economics"

   Which type is the AI bubble? We'll have "a legion of technologists who are learning Tensorflow and Pytorch", but while "nominally open source" they're bound to Google and Facebook - "if those environments go away, those programming skills become a lot less useful."

4. A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI Releases Sensational New AI Model
   URL: [https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/a-quiet-revolution-mistral-ai-releases-sensational-new-ai-model-c17c663287f0](https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/a-quiet-revolution-mistral-ai-releases-sensational-new-ai-model-c17c663287f0)
   "startup Mistral AI posted a download link to their latest language model". In many ways it's equivalent to GPT4: context size of 32k tokens, and built using the “Mixture Of Experts” model, combining "several highly specialized language models... 8 experts with 7 billion parameters each: “8x7B”... a training method for AI systems in which, instead of a single model learning everything, a combination of sub-models is used", with a gating network " assigning tasks to the experts" and combining their insights.

5. Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…
   URL: [https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6](https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6)
   At an AI conference, Jeff Jarvis "knew I was in the right place when I heard AGI brought up and quickly dismissed... I call bullshit... large language models might prove to be a parlor trick". The rest of the conference focused on "frameworks for discussion of responsible use of AI".

6. I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened
   URL: [https://medium.com/the-generator/i-trained-chatgpt-on-my-notes-heres-what-happened-1dcb48725f45](https://medium.com/the-generator/i-trained-chatgpt-on-my-notes-heres-what-happened-1dcb48725f45)
   Like me, the author has "been taking notes for over a decade ...ended up with thousands of notes that I never revisited. So I decided to train ChatGPT on my 3,743 Obsidian notes", which were created for "one purpose: content creation. So I use an improved version of the Zettelkasten".

# Editorial: Unpacking the AI Bubble and the Impact of Automated Content Generation

The ever-expanding realm of artificial intelligence has recently sparked debates and discussions across various domains. From its implications in automated content generation to its potential as a tool for responsible AI development, the following articles delve into different facets of AI's current landscape. Let's explore these themes that resonate through these articles.

## The Challenge of Automated Content Generation

In the article "Oops! We Automated Bullshit," MIT Professor Rodney Brooks and other experts raise concerns about AI-generated content, especially in the context of platforms like ChatGPT. They emphasize that while AI may produce text that "sounds good," it often lacks the logical foundation and factual accuracy needed for meaningful discourse. This highlights a growing concern that AI could become a source of persuasive but ultimately nonsensical content.

The article also references David Graeber's analysis of "Bullshit Jobs," where over 30% of British workers believe their jobs contribute nothing of value to society. The fear is that AI systems like ChatGPT can exacerbate this problem by automating tasks that involve generating meaningless reports, relaying messages, or responding to complaints, thereby perpetuating the existence of such "bullshit jobs."

## The AI Bubble: Learning from History

Cory Doctorow, in "What kind of bubble is AI?," draws parallels between the current AI bubble and historical economic bubbles. He identifies two types of bubbles: those that leave behind useful knowledge and those that leave "wreckage." Doctorow suggests that the AI bubble might be creating a legion of technologists skilled in Tensorflow and Pytorch, but their expertise is heavily tied to corporate giants like Google and Facebook. If these corporate environments diminish, these skills could become less valuable, echoing the potential pitfalls of previous bubbles.

## Advancements in AI Models

In "A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI Releases Sensational New AI Model," we witness the continuous evolution of AI models. Start-up Mistral AI introduces a new language model comparable to GPT-4. This model leverages the "Mixture Of Experts" approach, which combines highly specialized language models and a gating network to assign tasks to these experts. Such innovations push the boundaries of AI capabilities, showcasing the ongoing progress in the field.

## Responsible AI Development

Jeff Jarvis, in "Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…," highlights the importance of responsible AI use. He dismisses the notion of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a parlor trick, emphasizing the need for responsible frameworks for AI development. The focus should be on discussing ethical and responsible AI applications, reinforcing the theme of responsible AI development and deployment.

## AI for Content Creation

The author of "I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened" explores the potential of AI, particularly ChatGPT, in content creation. By training ChatGPT on their extensive notes, the author demonstrates the AI's utility in generating content. This reflects the growing trend of using AI to streamline and enhance creative processes.

In summary, these articles collectively underscore several key themes. The first revolves around the challenges posed by AI-generated content, with concerns about the quality and meaningfulness of such content. Second, the notion of an AI bubble prompts consideration of the long-term value of AI skills in an evolving technological landscape.

#### You:
Now you are going to generate the Graphviz code for a Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of these resources and themes, where each resources is connected to the relevant themes. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be squares and have the same size. The nodes representing the themes should be ellipses, and sized according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node.  
  
I will show you an example of some code for a concept map visualising 4 resources and three themes:  
graph ER {  
fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"  
node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
layout=neato  
node [shape=box]; theme1; "theme 2"; theme3;  
node [shape=ellipse]; resource1; "resource 2"; "resource 3"; "resource 4";  
  
theme1 -- resource1;  
theme1 -- "resource 2";  
theme1 -- "resource 3";  
theme3 -- "resource 2";  
"theme 2" -- "resource 2";  
theme3 -- resource1;  
theme3 -- "resource 4";  
"theme 2" -- "resource 4";  
label = "\n\A concept map\of your resources by theme";  
fontsize=20;  
}  
  
Now provide the same sort of code for the resources and themes, using the resource titles and the themes.

#### ChatGPT:
Here is the Graphviz code for the Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of the provided resources and themes:

```dot
graph ER {
  fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"
  node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
  edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
  layout=neato
  node [shape=box, width=1.5, height=1.5, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffd700"]; "Oops! We Automated Bullshit"; "What kind of bubble is AI?"; "A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI"; "Artificial General Bullshit"; "I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes";

  node [shape=ellipse, style=filled, fillcolor="#ff7f50", width=2.5, height=1.5];
  "Challenges of AI-Generated Content"; "AI Bubble and Skills Dependency"; "Advancements in AI Models"; "Responsible AI Development";

  "Challenges of AI-Generated Content" -- "Oops! We Automated Bullshit";
  "Challenges of AI-Generated Content" -- "I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes";
  "AI Bubble and Skills Dependency" -- "What kind of bubble is AI?";
  "Advancements in AI Models" -- "A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI";
  "Responsible AI Development" -- "Artificial General Bullshit";

  label = "\n\nA concept map of resources by theme";
  fontsize=20;
}
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Graphviz tool to visualize the concept map of the provided resources and themes. The size of the ellipses representing themes corresponds to their importance, with the most important theme having the largest node.


#### You:
Please update the visualisation as follows. The nodes representing the themes should be grey-filled ellipses, with their size adjusted according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node, and a correspondingly larger font size. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be yellow-filled rectangles. All Resource titles should fit snugly within their nodes' boundaries. Their texts should ideally all have the same font size, unless the title is very long. As the Resources' titles are often long, include labels for each Resource. Each Resource's label should be the same as the Resource's title, except that you should insert a linebreak ("\n") just before any hyphens, or just after any commas or full stops, and remove any reference to the publisher. If there are no such punctuation marks, insert a linebreak ("\n") after every 4 or 5 words. Remove any line breaks at the end of the Resource labels.  
  
Reduce node separation to make the concept map compact, but avoid overlaps.  
  
I will show you an example of some code for a concept map visualising 4 resources and three themes:  
graph ER {  
fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"  
node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
layout=neato  
edge [penwidth=1.5];  
overlap=false;  
nodesep=0.1; // Reduced node separation  
ranksep=0.5; // Reduced rank separation  
// Themes with labels and fontsize  
"Theme 1 title" [width=3, height=2, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];  
"Theme 2 title" [width=1.5, height=1, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];  
"Theme 3 title" [width=2, height=1, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];  
// Resources with labels and adjusted width and height  
"Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource Title 1 \n needs a linebreak", width=2, height=0.8, fontsize=10];  
"Resource 2 Title is very long and so has two linebreaks, a bigger box and a smaller font - New York Times" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 2 Title is very long \n and so has two linebreaks, a bigger \n box and a smaller font", width=2.5, height=1, fontsize=9];  
"Resource 3 Title is shorter - Nieman Lab" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 3 Title is short", width=1.5, height=0.8, fontsize=10];  
"Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 4 Title has \n - a hyphen", width=2, height=1, fontsize=10];  
  
"Theme 1 title" -- "Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak"  
"Theme 1 title" -- "Resource 2 Title is very long and so has two linebreaks, a bigger box and a smaller font - New York Times"  
"Theme 1 title" -- "Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen"  
"Theme 2 title" -- "Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen"  
"Theme 3 title" -- "Resource 3 Title is shorter - Nieman Lab"  
"Theme 3 title" -- "Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak"  
  
}
Now provide the same sort of code for the resources and themes we developed earlier.

#### ChatGPT:
Here is the updated Graphviz code for the Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of the provided resources and themes:

```dot
graph ER {
  fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"
  node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
