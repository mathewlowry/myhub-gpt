#### You:
There should only be 6 episodes in total. Each episode should focus on Vivek's quest to obtain one of the infinity stones. In the original Marvel story, each infinity stones had a specific colour and gave the holder a special power. They were:
* Space Stone (Blue): the power to create portals to teleport
* Mind Stone (Yellow): the power to control minds, enhance the user's intelligence, and create new life
* Reality Stone (Red): the power to create and alter reality 
* Power Stone (Purple): the power to create and alter reality 
* Time Stone (Green): the power to control and manipulate time
* Soul Stone (Orange):	the power to manipulate the soul and essence of a person

For each episode, create a challenge which Vivek must overcome on the road to the Presidency, and which rewards him with one of the stones. Each stone is then critical to the next challenge, and so will be used in the next episode. For example, getting the nomination as the Republican Party's candidate would be a major challenge, and so could give him the Power Stone, which he would use to escape a legal challenge to his candidacy.
