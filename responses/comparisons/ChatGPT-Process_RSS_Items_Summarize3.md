Give or take a month or two, my short stint fell in the middle of EurActiv’s 15 years of life so far. </p><p>As I pointed out recently when I returned, EurActiv&#x27;s story is quite unique: </p><ul><li>it’s that rarest of objects: an EC-funded project that resulted in a self-sustaining, successful business.

The legacy media that have survived so far, meanwhile, have digitised their newsrooms, upended their processes, created new content forms and adapted to social media. All of that … to face their fifth (or is it sixth?) existential threat in the form of programmatic advertising, ad blockers and the loss of control to Facebook.</p><h2>The digital natives arrive</h2><p>Watching their struggles, a new generation of &quot;digital native&quot; media emerged in the US: Buzzfeed, Vox, Upworthy, Quartz, Vice, Politico, Circa (RIP) and more are <i>technology companies that do news,</i> rather than news organisations adopting technology they barely understood. </p><p>As such, most are powered by completely different ideas of what media can be. On the one hand they represent a collective breath of fresh air, releasing the news industry from its ‘dead tree’ paradigm and exploring new forms of telling society stories about itself. But unlike the first batch of dotcoms, <b>they have new business models which have raised serious concerns for the future of journalism, and hence democracy.</b> They&#x27;ve also raised hundreds of millions in venture capital and are expanding globally (see <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/10/01/venture-backed-us-media-over-funded-over-here/">Venture-backed US media: over-funded &amp; over here?</a>), so it’s time for Europe to look at what these business models mean for Europe.</p><h2>A native advertising future</h2><p>So where does EurActiv fit in this picture? Nowhere. Unlike the dotcom startups it launched alongside in 1999, EurActiv created a sustainable business model based on ideas - like ‘Section Sponsorship’ - which were quite controversial at the time. 15 years later, it&#x27;s clear that this insulated EurActiv from the worst excesses of the advertising-driven &quot;<i>publish anything to get clicks</i>&quot; model pushing today&#x27;s online media in a race to the bottom. </p><p>Today, however, Section Sponsorship looks laughably conservative compared to the digital natives&#x27; <b>brand journalism and native advertising</b>, where companies, political parties and even <i>churches</i> pay for content created by the media&#x27;s own journalists. <b>This paid-for journalism is not published as an ad.</b> Instead, it appears as part of the independent journalism, and is almost indistinguishable from it. </p><p>The articles may be labelled, but the terms used - &quot;sponsored content&quot; (Slate), “presented by” (Huffington Post), &quot;paid posts&quot; (New York Times) - are <i>designed</i> to not draw attention to the fact that the media is now pushing a corporate interest. And it works: </p><ul><li>of the 71% of readers who noticed ad content in a Triplelift study, 62% percent didn’t realize they were looking at an ad (<a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/5-charts-show-problem-native-ad-disclosure/">Digiday</a>)</li><li>in four of the six groups shown a native advertisement <a href="https://contently.com/strategist/2015/09/08/article-or-ad-when-it-comes-to-native-no-one-knows/">in a Contently study</a>, the majority interpreted native advertising as articles</li></ul><p>European media had little choice but to follow suit – today you&#x27;ll find &quot;paid posts&quot; in the Financial Times, The Times and Sunday Times, the Guardian and even The Sun, to name a few British papers. What was worse-than-controversial 15 years ago, in other words, is now commonplace. </p><p>So what&#x27;s in store in another 15 years? <b>An online swamp of  ‘pay to play’ brand journalism written on behalf of</b> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/937b06c2-3ebd-11e4-adef-00144feabdc0.html"><b>industry</b></a><b>,</b> <a href="http://www.cjr.org/analysis/a_major_player_in_the.php"><b>political parties</b></a><b>,</b> <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-greenpeace-hires-journalists-its-a-double-edged-sword-47398"><b>NGOs</b></a><b> and</b> <a href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/200593/the-atlantic-pulls-sponsored-content-from-church-of-scientology/"><b>anyone else with a marketing budget</b></a><b>?</b></p><p></p><h2>Europe’s role</h2><p>The EU public sphere is unlikely to emerge in such an environment, so it&#x27;s odd that the EU&#x27;s communications strategy seems focused on bypassing European media entirely with multimillion TV and social media advertising campaigns.</p><p>Of course, given how some media behave towards the EU, one can hardly blame the Institutions for taking the opportunity to go direct to citizens. <b>Nevertheless, an enlightened EU communications strategy would focus on helping European media build the EU Online Public Sphere.</b> </p><p>Such a programme, encompassing everything from research and innovation support through to authentic engagement by EU Institutions on quality media, would probably look more like an industrial policy than a communications strategy. Given the importance of independent media industry to European jobs, culture, multilingual diversity and democracy, I fail to see the problem. As an added bonus, the longterm benefits to EU communications would be profound, for one simple reason:</p><blockquote><b>A healthy EU Public Sphere will carry the EC’s message more efficiently than any communications project ever could</b> - <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2012/01/16/an-alternative-overarching-eu-communication-strategy/">An alternative overarching EU communication strategy?</a></blockquote><p>The alternative is risking letting independent journalism die, and leaving European democracy to the tender mercies of Facebook&#x27;s algorithms and corporate-funded journalism. </p><p><b>Further reading</b>    </p><ul><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/11/10/25-years-later/">25 years later</a> (Nov 2014)</li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/10/01/venture-backed-us-media-over-funded-over-here/">Venture-backed US media: over-funded &amp; over here?</a> (Oct 2014)</li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2012/01/16/an-alternative-overarching-eu-communication-strategy/">An alternative overarching EU communication strategy?</a> (Jan 2012)</li><li><a href="https://contently.com/strategist/2015/09/08/article-or-ad-when-it-comes-to-native-no-one-knows/">Study: Article or Ad?

Sure, I can process the RSS items as you requested. Here are the extracted titles and cleaned main contents for the provided RSS items:

1. **Title:** Towards a 21st century EU Communications Strategy
   **URL:** <https://myhub.ai/items/towards-a-21st-century-eu-communications-strategy-2>

   **Main Content:**
   Imported from the Blogactiv.eu blogging platform, closed without warning in 2021. Links, images and embeds not guaranteed, and comments not displayed.
   With independent journalism increasingly looking like an endangered species, a EU communication strategy that helped European media build the European Public Sphere would be a smarter longterm move than propaganda and brochureware.
   This is a longer version of an article I contributed to an upcoming book about EurActiv's first 15 years.
   Democracies need media to survive in much the same way that fish need the medium of water to survive - they don’t eat it, they don’t drink it, it’s just the only medium they can actually exist in. Our media - from traditional newspapers through to blogs and social media platforms - carry our political debates. Without it, no democracy - just press releases.
   European issues, viewed nationally
   Which is why European democracy - and hence Europe - has a problem: while political and economic issues have become inextricably European in scale and nature, our media still frame the debates through national lenses. Instead of a European policy debate, we have 28 national debates about Europe - each from a national “how can we get the most out of it” perspective - plus a 29th in the Brussels Bubble, an echo chamber in which generations of Eurocognescenti debate amongst themselves in their own impenetrable jargon.
   This doesn't seem that well understood in Brussels - echo chambers tend to blind their inhabitants - but those outside the EU seem to see it pretty clearly - just this month:

   - [George Friedman: The EU is increasingly unreliable and unpredictable](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/george-friedman-eu-increasingly-unreliable-and-unpredictable-320982)
   - [Davos report warns of EU disintegration](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/davos-report-warns-eu-disintegration-321011)
   - [Terrorism, Migrants, and Crippling Debt: Is This the End of Europe?](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/europe-terrorism-migrants-debt-crisis)
   - (or see [25 years later](http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/11/10/25-years-later/), Nov 2014).
     A truly European debate can only be supported by something called the European Public Sphere, the lack of which used to be a rather academic topic, discussed with much handwringing by young political scientists as they prepared their EU Commission entrance exams. Today, however, there is little doubt that the hapless flailing of Europe’s leaders wrestling with today's crises is caused partly by the fact that they’re working within a EUropean context, but answering to voters who see issues mainly from national perspectives. The greatest irony is that these crises:
   - are pushing EU issues onto the front page, thus making today probably the best moment to encourage the development of the European Public Sphere
   - unfortunately coincide with another crisis – the one facing independent media, without which the European Public Sphere cannot exist.
     Europe needs a healthy independent media capable of underpinning the European Public Sphere. As it happens, EurActiv’s path over the past 15 years helps illustrate how this can be achieved.
     Born in the first dotcom
     Eight years ago I helped launch BlogActiv before returning to EU communications. Give or take a month or two, my short stint fell in the middle of EurActiv’s 15 years of life so far.
     As I pointed out recently when I returned, EurActiv's story is quite unique:
   - it’s that rarest of objects: an EC-funded project that resulted in a self-sustaining, successful business. Most don’t.
   - and not just any sort of business: an online media business, born in the first dotcom, which survived the first dotcom crash. Most didn’t.
   - and not just any online media business – an EU-focused media business. Few survive.
   - and not just one business – the EurActiv network provides free access to news and opinion on EU affairs in 12 languages, localised to 12 countries.
     That uniqueness can be traced back to when EurActiv launched. Back at the turn of the century, legacy media were still outsourcing their websites as they struggled with the upcoming revenue plunge a few of them could dimly see approaching. But they still had no idea just how bad things were going to get.
     In parallel, a bewildering array of content startups were busily burning through venture capital as if it would never stop. But it did: today, those startups are a distant memory. The legacy media that have survived so far, meanwhile, have digitised their newsrooms, upended their processes, created new content forms and adapted to social media. All of that … to face their fifth (or is it sixth?) existential threat in the form of programmatic advertising, ad blockers and the loss of control to Facebook.
     The digital natives arrive
     Watching their struggles, a new generation of "digital native" media emerged in the US: Buzzfeed, Vox, Upworthy, Quartz, Vice, Politico, Circa (RIP) and more are technology companies that do news, rather than news organisations adopting technology they barely understood.
     As such, most are powered by completely different ideas of what media can be. On the one hand they represent a collective breath of fresh air, releasing the news industry from its ‘dead tree’ paradigm and exploring new forms of telling society stories about itself. But unlike the first batch of dotcoms, they have new business models which have raised serious concerns for the future of journalism, and hence democracy. They've also raised hundreds of millions in venture capital and are expanding globally (see Venture-backed US media: over-funded & over here?), so it’s time for Europe to look at what these business models mean for Europe.
     A native advertising future
     So where does EurActiv fit in this picture? Nowhere. Unlike the dotcom startups it launched alongside in 1999, EurActiv created a sustainable business model based on ideas - like ‘Section Sponsorship’ - which were quite controversial at the time. 15 years later, it's clear that this insulated EurActiv from the worst excesses of the advertising-driven "publish anything to get clicks" model pushing today's online media in a race to the bottom.
     Today, however, Section Sponsorship looks laughably conservative compared to the digital natives' brand journalism and native advertising, where companies, political parties and even churches pay for content created by the media's own journalists. This paid-for journalism is not published as an ad. Instead, it appears as part of the independent journalism, and is almost indistinguishable from it.
     The articles may be labelled, but the terms used - "sponsored content" (Slate), “presented by” (Huffington Post), "paid posts" (New York Times) - are designed to not draw attention to the fact that the media is now pushing a corporate interest. And it works:
   - of the 71% of readers who noticed ad content in a Triplelift study, 62% percent didn’t realize they were looking at an ad (Digiday)
   - in four of the six groups shown a native advertisement in a Contently study, the majority interpreted native advertising as articles
     European media had little choice but to follow suit – today you'll find "paid posts" in the Financial Times, The Times and Sunday Times, the Guardian and even The Sun, to name a few British papers. What was worse-than-controversial 15 years ago, in other words, is now commonplace.
     So what's in store in another 15 years? An online swamp of ‘pay to play’ brand journalism written on behalf of industry, political parties, NGOs and anyone else with a marketing budget?

2. **Title:** The “Other Side” Is Not Dumb
   **URL:** <https://medium.com/@SeanBlanda/the-other-side-is-not-dumb-2670c1294063>

   **Main Content:**

   The solution... sacrifice your carefully curated social performance and be willing to work with people who are not like you... enter every issue with the very real possibility that we might be wrong this time.

<description>The extremist adherents of this new political correctness have essentially taken a flamethrower to the public space and annihilated its center. Topics in American life that once were the legitimate subjects of debate between liberals and conservative are now off-limits and lead to immediate attack by the cultural establishment if raised at all. Any incorrect position ... just a slip of the tongue can lead to public ostracism and the loss of a job.... There is a huge vacuum left by this leftist attack on speech, and Trump is filling it.<p>Tags: trump, publicsphere, us</p></description>

Hey, it&#x27;s <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2012/02/17/10-things-the-eu-should-probably-know-about-social-media/">worked before</a>.<a href="http://www.digitaltonto.com/2012/the-new-consumer-conversation/">The New Consumer Conversation</a> over on Greg&#x27;s Digital Tonto blog is a case in point. His focus is consumer marketing, not (e)participation/democracy <i>et al</i>, but as usual he makes a lot of good points relevant to any discussion regarding EU Comms / Public Sphere. So go and read it now, and you&#x27;ll see that its about the conversations companies are now supposed to be having with consumers:</p><blockquote>&quot;Ever since social media came on the scene, a lot of people have been talking about brands initiating meaningful conversations with consumers.&quot;</blockquote><p>So I&#x27;m going to riff off this to talk about the conversations that <i>governments / public bodies</i> are supposed to be having with <i>citizens,</i> and what this implies for the EU.</p><h2>Products, Services and Brand Exchange</h2><p>After an approving look at an <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.be/2010/08/conversation-is-anyone-listening.html">Ad Contrarian post</a> on how most discussions about engagement are so much b*llsh*t (&quot;<i>people want ... products that work well, look nice, taste good and are reasonably priced from companies that treat them fairly. Is that so freaking difficult to understand?&quot;), </i>Greg posits that consumers want <b>brand exchange</b>, a transaction which is now expanding to include social aspects. </p><p>[Aside: Now what <i>citizens</i> want, surely, is a society over which they have democratic control which lets them get on with their lives without collapsing spectacularly, or robbing them of their savings while punishing the innocent and rewarding the guilty. It&#x27;s not that freaking hard to understand.] </p><p><b>Greg breaks brand exchange</b> <b><i>in the era of social media</i></b><b> into three categories:</b></p><h2>Product value exchange</h2><p><b>What is it?</b> Consumers want good value for money - see quote, above. Similarly,<i> citizens</i> expect good value for the public services they finance through taxation. </p><p><b>The good news</b> is that many national governments across Europe have really innovated over the past few years, using joined up egovernment to provide better value, more responsive services to their citizens. </p><p><b>The bad news</b> for the EU Institutions is that, with a few exceptions, they do <i>not</i> provide front office services. A lot of the EU&#x27;s work in &#x27;joined up egovernment&#x27;, for example, is <i>between</i> governments, and hence behind the scenes for 99.9% of the population. EU citizens thus know they pay for the EU (financially and democratically), but rarely feel any services. Unless you count &quot;preventing war&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t have the impact it did during the Cold War (see <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/11/10/25-years-later/">25 years later</a>).</p><h2>Content Value Exchange</h2><p><b>What is it?</b> Well obviously, this is about content:</p><blockquote>&quot;Consumers increasingly expect <a href="http://www.moxieinteractive.com/pulse/2012/01/05/moxie-2012-trends-report-brands-as-partners/">brands to be partners</a> by helping them get maximum utility and enjoyment out of their purchase... the <a href="http://www.michelintravel.com/michelin-guides/">Michelin Guides</a> were originally conceived to help motorists get more out of driving to new places... L’Oreal Paris created the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/destinationbeauty">Destination Beauty</a> channel to give consumers advice on how to use their products...&quot;</blockquote><p><b>The good news:</b> EU sites like Your Europe (<a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Citizens</a> and <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/">Business</a>) help citizens get the most out of the Single Market and the freedoms the EU brings them, like the ability to travel and work, visa-free, across 28 countries. As I pointed out in 2011 (<a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2011/04/13/being-useful-beats-being-tuneful/">Being Useful beats Being Tuneful</a>) these sites both help citizens make the most of the EU, and in the process emphasise some of the EU&#x27;s most remarkable achievements -<b> by providing a useful </b><b><i>service</i></b><b>, not a brochure or advertising campaign which noone needs.</b> </p><p>So while the EU may not provide many &#x27;front of counter&#x27; services, it could do a <i>lot</i> more to communicate how to use useful EU achievements like freedom, mobility, trade, etc. Because if you help people take advantage of your services, they&#x27;ll use - and hence <i>value</i> - it more. This is common sense, not rocket science.</p><h2>Social Value exchange</h2><p><b>What is it?</b> Finally, Greg&#x27;s third category of brand exchange is about social, because:</p><blockquote>&quot;Every local pub owner has long understood that we’ll pay a whole lot more to go to a place where we can meet interesting people than we will to get drunk at home&quot;</blockquote><p>In other words, organisations can benefit from creating social value through<b> convening a community</b> around them. </p><p><b>Buried lede</b>: Hence my upcoming <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2015/07/27/three-online-community-case-studies-lined-up-for-europcom2015/">EuroPCom workshop on online communities</a>. While not all citizens will want to get involved in Communities of Interest of Practice,  <i>everyone&#x27;s interested in something ...</i> and the EU is active in almost every field. Pulling the &#x27;interested general public&#x27; into online communities convened around EU policies and/or programmes both enhances them (widening consultation, transparency and participation; diversifying perspectives, etc.) <i>and</i> brings significant communications side benefits. Why? Because online communities foster <i>deep</i> <i>engagement -</i> creating Greg&#x27;s social value exchange - to a degree that getting Likes on Facebook cannot reach. </p><p><b>The bad news:</b> As mentioned in some <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/tag/event/">earlier posts</a>, the EU has been convening pan-EU Communities of Interest and/or Practice for many decades, each bringing together people from across Europe to tackle similar problems and learn from each other. But only stakeholders - &#x27;in the loop&#x27;, with a travel budget or an office in Brussels - participated. If EU programme and policy development managers <i>don&#x27;t</i> open their processes to wider audiences, they&#x27;ll remain dominated by the usual suspects in the Brussels Bubble, as has been the case since the 1950s. Maybe that makes the Institutions&#x27; lives easier, but it limits the inputs to those processes, reduces their eventual impact and makes them basically invisible to 99% of the EU population. </p><p><b>The good news: </b>online communities began widening this net <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2009/09/01/building-communities-with-event-in-a-box/">in 2002</a>, allowing non-specialists from outside the Brussels Bubble to get involved. These communities are best integrated with the existing communities (physical networking events, etc.) and need policy traction to create rewards for high-quality online participation. The technology has been there for ages, and the approach has been proved again and again. The only question is therefore why these online communities remain the exception, not the rule.</p><blockquote>“The shift right now for government is from being bureaucratic and authoritative to being open and sharing and collaborative.” -  Lena Trudeau, US General Services Administration (GSA), quoted in &quot;<a href="https://tonylbxl.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/collaboration-top-priority-for-government-communication/">Collaboration top priority for government communication</a>&quot;, Tony Lockett, March 2013</blockquote><p>Tags: social media, community, propaganda, publicsphere, communications, engagement</p></description>

<description><p><i>Imported from the Blogactiv.eu blogging platform, closed without warning in 2021. Links, images and embeds not guaranteed, and comments not displayed.</i></p><p><b>An array of sophisticated language technologies could help ideas flow across EU borders, link national conversations together and support the EU Online Public Sphere - the</b> <b><i>demos</i></b><b> the EU needs. But BloggingPortal is unlikely to feature them.</b> </p><p><i>[update (17/5/15): I finally decided to kick Medium&#x27;s tyres </i><a href="https://medium.com/@mathewlowry/advanced-technologies-for-european-democracy-e3c3ecbbe996"><i>by reposting this there</i></a><i>, with less history. Medium&#x27;s editor is actually as good as they say, but don&#x27;t take my word for it.] </i></p><p>Years ago I realised that a couple of innovative technologies (semantic analysis, machine translation, coupled with faceted &amp; federated search) could help support the development of the EU Online Public Sphere, and with it EU democracy and publishing. Moreover, the venerable (and currently crashed - again!) <a href="http://bloggingportal.eu">BloggingPortal</a> site, which has been curating EU-oriented content since 2009, was the ideal platform for it. </p><p>After years of twisting the other BloggingPortal Editors&#x27; arms, the BloggingPortal Reboot project was born in September 2013. Unfortunately, this is probably my last post on the project (all <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/tag/bloggingportal2/">18 here</a>). Which is a shame, because recently I and others, while developing a Horizon2020 (EC research &amp; innovation) funding proposal, identified additional technologies (auto-summary, sentiment analysis, etc.) to make &#x27;machine-assisted human curation&#x27; even more useful. So I thought I&#x27;d close this series of posts by summarising the approach, in case anyone else wants to use these technologies to build bridges across Europe. For those familiar with the project, the new technologies kick in at the end, so scroll down.</p><h2>Recap: Existing BloggingPortal model</h2><p><b>The original idea of the reboot (working title: &quot;Hashtag Europe&quot;) was to plug advanced semantic technologies into the existing BloggingPortal model, so let&#x27;s start with that:</b></p><p>[slideshare id=47360440&amp;doc=htageu-final2015-existing-150424011946-conversion-gate02] </p><ol><li><b>initial curation</b>: volunteer Editors identify and add a source of relevant content to the engine</li><li>the title and opening words of each new post is <b>automatically piped</b> into the engine</li><li>volunteer editors <b>manually tag each post</b> to help users find them later, and highlight the best posts</li><li>the posts are <b>published</b> on the site, pointing back to the original content (our aim is to help publishers find new audiences, not rob them of traffic). Note:</li></ol><ul><li>BP search only searched the blog description, not the posts</li><li>browsing by tags only worked if the Editors tagged the posts</li></ul><ol><li>the best (i.e., manually highlighted) posts appear on the Home Page and are <b>promoted by enewsletter and Twitter</b></li></ol><p></p><p>Then the volunteers finished Uni and got on with their lives. Manual tagging stopped happening, turning BP into nothing more than a glorified RSS feed for the Brussels Bubble, for whom &quot;<i>everything about the EU</i>&quot; is still relevant and useful. </p><p>Which is a shame, because outside the Bubble, most people are interested in <i>something</i> - it&#x27;s just not the EU. Provide them with a source of interesting content from across Europe <i>relevant to their interests</i> (environment, employment law, research, human rights ...), and they may discover ideas - and their authors - from other countries. They may even even better understand the European aspect of their field of interest (see <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2010/07/20/vacancies-specialists-required-to-build-bridges/">Specialists required to build bridges)</a>. </p><p>Without volunteer editors categorising each article, BP couldn&#x27;t provide streams of content by topic, or a library where you could find useful content from before last week (see <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/11/03/all-stream-no-memory-zero-innovation/">All stream, no memory, zero innovation</a>). Moreover, focusing only on blogs seriously limited its relevance.</p><p></p><h2>Hashtag Europe: Add automated semantic analysis ...</h2><p><b>Hence the revised model - &#x27;machine-assisted human curation&#x27;:</b> </p><p>[slideshare id=47432854&amp;doc=htageu-final2015-hashtag1-150426141426-conversion-gate02]</p><ol><li>As before, sources are identified manually - <b>human curation is still essential.<br/></b>However, the scope is widened to<b> all sources and types</b> of relevant longform content (news, analyses, research, feature articles...).</li><li><b>The entirety</b> of each article is crawled into the engine as it is published (but <i>never</i> displayed in full on the site)</li><li>Language recognition and semantic analysis software then <b>automatically tag each article</b> using the multilingual, policy-oriented <a href="http://eurovoc.europa.eu/drupal/">EUROVOC taxonomy.</a> Note:<ul><li>I explored two semantic engines. My preference is <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/02/28/bloggingportal-meet-apache-stanbol/">Apache Stanbol</a>, developed within EC-funded R&amp;D, donated to the open-source Apache Foundaton, currently covering 7-8 languages. The other was <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/10/13/first-tests-of-context-on-bloggingportal-reboot/">ConText</a>.</li><li>The tags are used to map each article to 1-2 high-level Themes, used in site navigation, enewsletters, etc (see below).</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>The title and opening lines of each article is <b>auto-published</b> on the relevant Theme and tag menus. Note:<ul><li>the search engine <b>searches the entirety</b> of each article</li><li><b>registered users can highlight</b> articles (cf <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>)</li></ul></li></ol><h2>... powering faceted search</h2><p><b>With each article consistently tagged, faceted search makes it incredibly easy to discover Who is saying What in any policy area, today, yesterday or even years previously, in many languages.</b> </p><p>Some wireframes from the specs show how: [slideshare id=47449975&amp;doc=htageu-final2015-faceted1-150427033334-conversion-gate01] </p><ol><li>Welcome to the Home Page. Site navigation is actually a natural language phrase: &quot;<i>Show me the</i> <b><i>best</i></b><i> content about</i> <b><i>all themes</i></b><i> about</i> <b><i>all countries</i></b><i> written originally in</i> <b><i>any language</i></b> <b><i>any time&quot;</i></b></li><li>Each key phrase (in colour, above) is a filter, with mouseovers allowing users to change their settings. The only filter active on the Home Page is &quot;<b>Best</b>/All&quot; - i.e.,  Home shows the content highlighted manually (by users or Editors) across all Themes, countries, etc</li><li>So let&#x27;s tweak those filters to: <b>all</b> content classified <b>Environment</b> published <b>this week. </b>Tthere are 16 results - the &#x27;Refine tool&#x27; now shows the tags assigned to them, used to map them to the &#x27;Environment&#x27; Theme</li><li>So click &#x27;windfarm&#x27;: we now have <b>all</b> content tagged <b>windfarm</b> published <b>this week</b><ul><li>the &#x27;Environment&#x27; Theme was replaced by the far narrower &#x27;windfarm&#x27; tag</li><li>there are only 4 results</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>So let&#x27;s add a second tag to narrow the search, but increase the time horizon: <b>all</b> content tagged <b>windfarm AND wildlife</b> published <b>this year</b></li></ol><p>Wireframe testing showed this approach allowed users to drill down to exactly the resources they want in under a minute. But we&#x27;re just getting started...</p><p></p><h2>Human curation &amp; distribution</h2><p><b>People remain part of the process.</b> </p><p>Freed from tagging each article manually, Editors, other volunteers and indeed users can add value in better ways. Moreover, the content doesn&#x27;t just live on the site: [slideshare id=47432966&amp;doc=htageu-final2015-4-editors-150426141908-conversion-gate02] </p><ol><li>Editors, like users, can <b>highlight the best articles</b> to the Home Page, but can also <b>validate/edit the tags</b> assigned by the machines.<ul><li>Human tag validation could be used to <b>&#x27;train&#x27; Stanbol in another 9-10 languages</b>, ensuring Europe&#x27;s open-source semantic analysis software covers all European languages.</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>Highlighted articles, as before, are promoted by <b>enewsletter and Twitter</b>, but now <b>newsletters and Twitter feeds</b> <b><i>per Theme</i></b> become possible...</li><li>... as is an <b>API,</b> which would allow other publishers to pipe the firehose of semantically-enriched content into their CMS for further processing and syndication, increasing content discovery further.</li></ol><p>Volunteers can also provide other &#x27;added value&#x27; activities, from promoting the service to manually curating specific Themes. The latter is covered later, as first I need to introduce a new sort of interface.</p><h2>The Rebelview interface</h2><p><b>There&#x27;s another, completely different way of consuming this content, courtesy of RebelMouse, who agreed to sponsor us by providing premium services for free for the first year.</b> </p><p>The Home Page, each Theme and each Country all get a Rebelview: a quite beautiful newsmagazine interface to the content within it (see <a href="https://www.rebelmouse.com/bloggingportal/">BloggingPortal&#x27;s Rebelmouse account</a> if  this is new to you). It works like this: </p><p>[slideshare id=47413397&amp;doc=htageu-final2015-rebelview-150425172319-conversion-gate01]   </p><ol><li>As mentioned above, <b>all articles get Tweeted</b>:<ul><li>by the Twitter account(s) for the <b>Theme(s)</b> it was classified under</li><li>by a Twitter account per <b>country</b> (some Themes are geographic)</li><li>the <b>best</b> articles are also Tweeted by the principal account</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>Each Twitter account drives a<b> Rebelmouse accoun</b>t, embedded on the site, giving us a &#x27;Rebelview&#x27; of the best content on RebelView Home ...</li><li>... and Rebelviews of all content per Theme ...</li><li>... and a Rebelview for each country.</li></ol><p>While Rebelview doesn&#x27;t let you drill down into the tags, and so is less powerful than &#x27;Refine View&#x27;, above, it certainly is a more fun, <i>newsy</i> way of consuming the content.</p><h2>Manually curated themes</h2><p><b>Finally, manually curated themes provide an additional layer of human curation and give the Theme&#x27;s Editor some visibility in return:</b></p><p>This remains only an idea - a lot will depend on the Editors, of course. When an article is auto-categorised under Theme being <i>manually</i> curated, it is first proposed for validation by that Theme&#x27;s Editor. Only validated articles are published, appearing in the Theme&#x27;s <b>&quot;Editor&#x27;s Picks&quot; page,</b> dedicated<b> Twitter stream</b> and<b> enewsletter</b>. The wireframe also shows a <b>Twitter List</b> and <b>Resource Wiki</b> dedicated to the Theme, curated by our intrepid Editor. Both are optional. </p><p>In return, the Editor becomes a <b>highly visible bridge between national and EU communities</b> interested in that particular topic - essentially becoming the:</p><ul><li>national communities&#x27; “GoTo person&quot; for the EU in that Theme</li><li>Brussels Bubble&#x27;s “GoTo person&quot;  for that Theme at the national level</li></ul><h2>More advanced technologies (new)</h2><p>In January one of the technologists working on the H2020 proposal with me asked:</p><blockquote>Why not add auto-summary? Or sentiment mining? And where does the machine translation go?</blockquote><p>So I added a chapter and one more wireframe to the specs:</p><p></p><p>In this approach, &#x27;premium services&#x27; are accessed by selecting articles for processing (checkboxes, <i>left</i>) and choosing a service from the dropdown, <i>right</i>. These services could include:</p><h3>Machine translation</h3><p>Because the taxonomy is multilingual, the search results will be in many languages, unless you use the Language filter in the navigation. With this feature, users can select interesting looking articles to have their titles and abstract auto-translated, giving a better idea of whether the full article is worth visiting on the publisher&#x27;s site.</p><h3>Auto-summary</h3><p>This one&#x27;s fun. Choose a few resources and have a summary report produced for you, using technologies similar to <a href="http://summly.com/">Summly.</a> More: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization">Automatic summarisation on Wikipedia</a>.</p><h3>Sentiment analysis / Opinion mining</h3><p>Are the articles positive or negative? If you&#x27;re the sort of person who prefers checking out someone&#x27;s Klout score rather than actually reading what they produce, this is definitely for you. More: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">Sentiment analysis on Wikipedia</a>. And: <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2011/09/19/what-is-influence-or-why-i-dont-care-about-my-klout-score/">What is influence? or, Why I don’t care about my Klout score.</a></p><h2>Research required</h2><p>These are, of course, just a few of the huge number of language processing technologies under development, so if you can think of any others which could be useful in this particular context, drop me a line. All of these technologies, of course, open up many interesting questions in the areas of copyright and content monetisation. I was hoping that the research project could explore offering premium services on a subscription or micropayment (cf <a href="https://launch.blendle.com/">Blendle</a>) basis, allowing revenue sharing between BP and publishers. That would simultaneously support European media (by helping them monetise their back-catalogue) and the EU Online Public Sphere. Without the BloggingPortal domain name, that doesn&#x27;t look like it will happen today. But if anyone wants to discuss the specs, feel free to drop me a line.</p><h2>PS Looking to France</h2><p>Machine-assisted content discovery is a huge movement in the States, but in Europe the only example I&#x27;ve noticed so far is <a href="http://www.lesechos360.fr/">Echos360,</a> a French &#x27;aggrefilter&#x27; for business content:</p><blockquote>&quot;... unlike Google News that crawls an unlimited trove of sources, my original idea was to extract good business stories from both algorithmically and manually selected sources... to effectively curate specialized sources — niche web sites and blogs — usually lost in the noise&quot; - <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/02/09/building-a-business-news-aggrefilter/">Building a business news aggrefilter</a> (Monday Note, February 2014)</blockquote><p>So my original 2009 idea turns out to be an &#x27;aggrefilter&#x27;.

- **Description:** The extremist adherents of this new political correctness have essentially taken a flamethrower to the public space and annihilated its center.

Any incorrect position ... just a slip of the tongue can lead to public ostracism and the loss of a job.... There is a huge vacuum left by this leftist attack on speech, and Trump is filling it.
