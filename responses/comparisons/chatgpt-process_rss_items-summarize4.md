<title>Venture-backed US media: over-funded & over here?</title>

<description><p><i>Imported from the Blogactiv.eu blogging platform, closed without warning in 2021. Links, images and embeds not guaranteed, and comments not displayed.</i></p><p><b>If you care about EU democracy you need to care about European media, particularly as the upcoming US media invasion gets underway. They&#x27;ll be pushing on an open door when they get to Brussels.</b> </p><p>Anyone interested in the Internet and/or media and/or democracy should have followed the development of media business models since at least the late 1990s, when newspapers saw their classified advertising start drying up. The following decade saw a lot of thrashing around as revenue stream after revenue stream got hit (<i>banner advertising?</i> already bad, about to get worse. <i>Subscriptions &amp; paywalls?</i> only for the few). It&#x27;s only in the past couple of years that the business of journalism has seen any serious investment at all (see <a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/09/17/from-longform-renaissance-to-big-internet-disenchantment-b2b4me-part-2/">From longform renaissance to Big Internet disenchantment)</a>.</p><h3><b>Enter US venture capital</b></h3><p>However, that&#x27;s largely been by US venture capitalists. The problem is that last time VCs invested in online media they gave us social media platforms where the product on sale was <i>us</i>. The result of this was put best - at least recently - by Quinn Norton, one of many to write about the impending launch of the advertising-free Ello social platform:</p><blockquote>&quot;<i>venture capitalists... are a much worse deal than most people realize...you have to make stratospheric amounts of money, or you have to die. You can’t be moderately successful, you can’t build a sustainable business...</i> <i>When the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter signed up for that money, they signed away any chance of building privacy for their users....  Big social networks seek an impossible level of total user engagement. The more they have you, and the more they have on you, the more they can feed their demons</i>.&quot; - Quinn Norton, <a href="https://medium.com/message/what-does-ethical-social-networking-software-look-like-315373c898edhttp://">What Does Ethical Social Networking Software Look Like?</a></blockquote><p>Which is ironic, given that Ello took venture capital and don&#x27;t mention it anywhere:</p><blockquote>&quot;<i>When you take venture capital, it is not a matter of if you’re going to sell your users, you already have... In the myopic and upside-down world of venture capital, exits precede the building of the actual thing itself. It would be a comedy if the repercussions of this toxic system were not so tragic... It is the opposite of a long-term, sustainable business</i>.&quot; - <a href="https://aralbalkan.com/notes/ello-goodbye/">Ello, Goodbye</a>. Aral Balkan</blockquote><p>The voracity of VC is why social media platforms are constantly tweaking their algorithms to keep you clicking, clicking, clicking<i>.</i> With every click they give you a little dopamine rush, and in return get a little piece of you to sell to advertisers. And they want their investments to sell <i>more</i> of you every year. </p><p>The twin pressures of declining newspaper revenues and exploding social media platforms gave us a media landscape of:</p><ul><li><b>clickbait</b>: content created to be shared (let&#x27;s just ignore the fact that noone&#x27;s actually reading it);</li><li><b>corporate journalism</b>: why bother with journalists when you can pass your PR off <i>as</i> journalism?</li><li><b>native advertising</b>: let&#x27;s pay those desperate hacks to write our advertising copy for us - as a bonus, they&#x27;ll blend our paid-for articles so well into their &#x27;real&#x27; journalism that a majority of readers <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/sponsored-content-can-lead-to-a-loss-of-credibility-for-news-story-study/article19717229/">can&#x27;t tell the difference</a>.</li></ul><p><a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2014/07/09/study-sponsored-content-has-a-trust-problem-2/"><i>Original link</i></a><br/></p><blockquote>&quot;Two-thirds of respondents said that they’ve felt deceived upon realizing that an article or video was sponsored by a brand&quot; - <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2014/07/09/study-sponsored-content-has-a-trust-problem-2/">Study: Sponsored Content Has a Trust Problem</a>, Contently</blockquote><h3><b>Native advertising</b></h3><p>And native advertising, it seems, may not just be the Next Big Thing, it may actually <i>work</i>... at least from one perspective. However, there are two perspectives at play here: </p><p>a)<i> &quot;it&#x27;s the end of the world as we know it!&quot;:</i> </p><embed embedtype="media" url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_F5GxCwizc"/><p>Seriously, watch it - it&#x27;s hilarious. </p><p>b) <i>&quot;Goddamn it, native ads will be the only thing keeping the lights on in 3 years&quot;</i>, as told by NYTimes&#x27; Meredith Kopit Levien, lampooned in the above video.</p><blockquote>&quot;<i>The best way to preserve editorially independent, high quality journalism is to preserve the business model. And I think the idea of branded content that shares a form factor with editorial is a great first step.</i>” <br/>- <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/09/8553419/going-native-emtimesem">Going native at the <i>Times</i></a> , Capital New York</blockquote><h2>So here they come</h2><p>With existing media weakened, and a corporate journalism / native advertising business model which finally makes sense to them, a new wave of VC-funded, American news media are expanding globally, including Mashable, BuzzFeed, Vice Media and Business Insider (hat tip: <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/271105/mashable-too-heads-to-europe">Poynter</a>) and, of course, &quot;PoliticoEU&quot;, the Politico/Springer tie-up setting up here in Brussels. </p><p>And the many more startups recently infused with venture capital will be right behind them, from Circa to Gawker. VCs are voracious, right? Keeping growth up will inevitably mean expanding beyond the US - it&#x27;s just a question of time. </p><p>Of course, any investment in media is to be welcomed, and many of these outfits are actually betting against trends like clickbait and redefining the paradigm of what digital news is, as well as pushing forward news publishing technology. But many seem based on corporate journalism and native advertising, with many of the rest focused on free-riding on journalism - even one of my favoruite sites, longform, is in on the act with their latest mobile app:</p><blockquote>&quot;And what about the publishers who produce the content that will fill the Longform app? They will get pageviews, as articles in the app will default to a &quot;Web&quot; version when clicked on—though most users will likely opt for the &quot;Read&quot; version, which is just a tap away and is far more aesthetically pleasing.&quot; <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/09/8552657/journalism-curator-longform-launching-first-iphone-app">- Journalism curator Longform launching first iPhone app</a></blockquote><p>Translation: we&#x27;ll make money by sucking journalists&#x27; work into our app, where users can read it without being bothered by those pesky ads. Which pay the journalists salary. What could go wrong? Is it any wonder that journalism is embracing native advertising? </p><h2>Pushing on an open door </h2><p>In general, European media have been pretty slow to react to these trends, but the new arrivals will only accelerate change. Here in Brussels, moreover, they&#x27;ll be pushing on an open door. With a struggling media sector and an overabundance of lobbyists and PR firms, it is no wonder that corporate journalism and native advertising is already alive and well. Take a look, for example, at this EurActiv special report, as shared on LinkedIn:</p><p><a href="https://myhub.ai/media/dumps/260/files/2014/09/euractiv-linkedin-nativeadvertising11.jpg"><i>Original link</i></a><br/></p><p>OK, I don&#x27;t get a content strategy revolving around what looks like a PDF report either, but if you assume that&#x27;s a given, it&#x27;s a pretty good use of Slideshare and LinkedIn. </p><p><i>Above</i>, the LinkedIn update provides an image (albeit the publication front page), and cites the author - a good example of a media putting its journalists forward via social media. The update of the &quot;sharer&quot; (Rick) provides an intriguing, curiosity-inducing quote (<i>maybe I have diabetes!</i>). The actual summary text, however, is much less compelling (page numbers on social media content?). Clicking on the media, <i>below</i>, opens a Slideshare popup (LinkedIn bought Slideshare a while back), making the content easier to read (once you go fullscreen), framed with comments:</p><p><a href="https://myhub.ai/media/dumps/260/files/2014/09/euractiv3.jpg"><i>Original link</i></a><br/></p><p>It took me a minute or two to spot the corporate sponsorship, in the upper right corner, and I used to <i>work</i> at EurActiv, where sponsorship has been part of the business model since launch. Before you think I&#x27;m being critical, I&#x27;m not. They are, after all, one of the few survivors of the very first dotcom news bubble, 15 years ago. Surviving sure beats going under, particularly in a sector - EU media - where most have failed (see the <a href="http://euroman.blogactiv.eu/2014/09/11/media4eu-0f-20-media-groups-to-%e2%80%98go-european%e2%80%99-most-failed/">exhaustive list</a> by founder Christophe Leclerq).</p><h3><b>Premonitions, not growing pains</b></h3><p>But until recently I was sort of hoping that EurActiv&#x27;s business model was the growing pains of a new EU media sector, that would one day be able to afford a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_wall">Chinese wall</a> between journalism and advertising. Modern journalism, after all, developed out of 19th century media practices that would turn your hair white if you read it today. But with the US model now in full export mode, it turns out that EurActiv was a premonition of more to come. Is it a problem? I&#x27;ll leave the last word to Christophe, who <a href="http://euroman.blogactiv.eu/2014/09/12/media4eu-14-could-springerpolitico-succeed-where-most-%e2%80%98european-media%e2%80%99-failed-10-strategic-challenges/">seems to criticise</a> &quot;<i>US PR-style ‘native advertising&#x27;, ie  ‘sponsored articles’</i>&quot; in contrast to &quot;<i>transparent, general support for broader coverage, practiced for EurActiv’s policy sections</i>&quot;. </p><p>I&#x27;m not sure the above example is aligned with that policy, but I&#x27;m happy to be corrected. What I <i>am</i> pretty sure that media needs to survive, and that, in the end, <b>this mess is our fault</b> <b>because we&#x27;re not paying for quality journalism.</b> You only get what you pay for. </p><p>--------</p><h3>Relevant reading</h3><ul><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/09/17/from-longform-renaissance-to-big-internet-disenchantment-b2b4me-part-2/">From longform renaissance to Big Internet disenchantment</a></li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2014/01/26/bloggingportal-presseurop/">BloggingPortal + PressEurop = ?</a></li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2011/11/02/do-we-need-more-eu-platforms-or-sustainable-eu-media/">Do we need more EU platforms, or sustainable EU media?</a></li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2011/09/28/the-value-of-politically-motivated-news/">The value of politically-motivated news</a></li><li><a href="http://mathew.blogactiv.eu/2010/10/15/oh-so-its-the-medias-fault-noone-likes-the-eu/">Oh, so it’s the media’s fault noone likes the EU …</a></li></ul><p><i>Most of my writing is inspired by and sourced from the stuff I put on my TumblrHub public library every day.

The opposite of surveillance is user-centered design and strong, principled design is the only way we can compete with the invasion of US start-ups that want to do to us what they did to the Arab Spring in Syria. For the past few years, the European Commission has been quite interested in what it calls the digital single market. It makes a lot of sense: one set of rules for a unified space could make it easier for the likes of Google and Facebook to grow their dominant positions...but, surely, also for ethical alternatives to grow as well? US company gets 30% of the eyeballs. Without getting into policy issues around e.g. net neutrality or copyright, it's clear that one advantage of a European player would be that their ambitions in EU space would be subject to the full range of EU competition rules. A company from Silicon Valley would also be subject to EU rules, of course, but I think there is a risk that it would be somewhat easier for a US-based company to go running to the US government for protection, using any actions by the EU as part of a narrative of EU bullying. Maybe I'm wrong. If you think I am, please explain to me why. So, I was excited to read that Spotify, backed by another big VC, was planning to launch in 100 countries at once (EU single market: here's looking at you!). But I was puzzled by the statement in Spotify’s news release: 'In each new market, we will work with local creators and partners to expand our music offering and deliver a Spotify experience that meets the unique needs of each market...' Does this mean there will be an actual product difference between markets, or is it just a neat way of saying 'our lawyers have ensured that our contracts with rights holders vary slightly across 100 countries'? Moreover, why launch in 100 countries? There may be some economies of scale in negotiating licensing rights, but surely not in launching marketing campaigns. Was Spotify looking for a single, media-friendly, launch date? My thinking was that it would be great to see Spotify succeed. Its deal with Uber is a great example of how artists and digital companies could work together (if they were both European). Even if I'm not much of a fan of much of Spotify's content, I think it's a useful service and I'd be happy for it to succeed in the marketplace. In part because I think Apple's acquisition of Beats will lead to a lot of innovation (not least on pricing and how we're all locked into ever-shorter proprietary media ecosystems), but also because I believe that the eventual home of Spotify's many competitors will be media platforms such as Amazon or Apple. I think an overfunded Spotify will continue to create the markets that will enable those more profitable acquisitions. And that would be a great outcome. But only if Spotify doesn't follow the usual Silicon Valley script. I'm going to remain optimistic. And my optimism is bolstered by Daniel Ek's own call for Spotify to rebrand itself as an infrastructure company. If that's true then the music marketplaces of Amazon, Apple, Google etc. will need Spotify as a partner. And that changes the balance of power in content markets considerably. It means that even these giants will be dependent on one particular distribution channel. Or, to put it in non-jargon, these companies won't be able to get their stuff to us if we stop using Spotify's infrastructure. That's potentially an epic shift. The key question for democracy advocates is how far Spotify's rebranding goes: Is it looking to monetise just its backend, or is it looking to mediate the market by e.g. making its playlists and recommendations the standard across all platforms?... Now back to Brussels... The Brussels media space, if we can still call it that, is in a state of crisis. We may now be getting to the stage where it's hard for democracy to function because there is no journalism. I don't know if it's reversible, but I do know that it will be very difficult to reverse without attention and resources. One of the reasons it's so important is that, despite all the attention on the problems of creating a European public sphere, little attention has been paid to the fact that the EU, compared to the US and the developing world, is underserved by media. (I could be wrong. If so, please let me know.) The other problem is that the EU is hard to cover. It's complicated, and you can't just parachute in to do a story on \[insert famous place here]. You've got to learn the EU. Even EU Correspondents tend to be national correspondents covering the EU on the side. So here's the first part of my list of what to look for: If we want to find out whether Spotify is looking to change the EU media marketplace, I think it's going to look more like partnerships than traditional launches: Daniel Ek and Spotify will be looking for media companies with the largest, most interesting, audiences and trying to work out how to reach them through Spotify's tech. If that's right, then I don't know how anyone can possibly suggest the outcome will be a worse media marketplace than the current one: it's hard to see how new entrants could make the marketplace less diverse or European journalism less innovative."
