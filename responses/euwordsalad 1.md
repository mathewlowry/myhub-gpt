1) defending European democracy and laws: 1,410 infringement procedures were initiated to enforce EU law, of which 65% were addressed by Member States

5) preparing countries for natural hazards
6) improving physical and mental health
7) supporting Ukraine and providing humanitarian aid across the world to those who need it the most
