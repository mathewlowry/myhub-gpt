<description><p><i>Imported from the Blogactiv.eu blogging platform, closed without warning in 2021. Links, images and embeds not guaranteed, and comments not displayed.</i></p><p><b>What happened when I was invited to “do a Rápido” at the IABC’s conference in Rotterdam earlier this week.</b></p><p>A Rápido, as I explored with it’s originator Ezri Carlzebach last year, is a maximum 5-minute image-rich presentation on any topic related to the conference theme. Given that the IABC are focusing on Driving Business With Communication this year, I thought I’d take the ideas from last year&#x27;s  Time to integrate Innovation into your Comms strategy and make them a little more accessible.</p><p>In the end I rattled through and got to the end with more than 20 seconds to spare. You have a little more time, because I’ve divided the show into 3 slideshares, with one numbered note for each slide from my speaking notes.</p><p></p><embed embedtype="media" url="http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/eurocomm2016-rpido-future-of-communications-part-1"/><p></p><ol><li>Maybe communications hasn&#x27;t changed that much from the 20th century. Back then, all you had to do was interrupt people with ads as they watched TV, or read newspapers.  Content was scarce; they had nowhere else to go. Simple!</li><li>Then for a moment everyone was a content producer?!?</li><li>And now the Internet is starting to look more like TV again. But instead of sitting around watching, we&#x27;re congregating in social platforms, where the entertainment is each other.</li><li><b>But communicators are still just interrupting us with ads!</b> We call it native ads in our newspapers &amp; content marketing in our newsfeeds, but most of it&#x27;s really just interruption advertising.</li><li>And the first signs of <b>content marketing failure</b> are already visible, because platforms cannot be designed for brands and people at the same time. Their interests oppose.</li></ol><p>Note: Slide 5 compares the number of YouTube subscribers of Redbull (marketing budget: 2bn/year, 5m subscribers) with PewDiePie (marketing budget: minimal-to-zero, 43m subscribers). Hat tip: Branding in the Age of Social Media (Harvard Business Review). </p><p></p><embed embedtype="media" url="http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/eurocomm2016-rpido-future-of-communications-part-2"/><p></p><ol><li>Maybe instead of using communications to tell people what a great product we have, we should <b>use communications to make a better product, and then communicate</b> <b><i>that</i></b><b>.</b>What would that look like? Consider:</li><li>We all know you can&#x27;t have good external communications without good internal communications - you need to integrate them to get your organisation&#x27;s stories out there</li><li>So let&#x27;s think about all that knowledge pouring into your organisation via your staff&#x27;s social networks, from social media monitoring programmes, front desks, website comments and more. <b>Is it getting where it needs to go inside your organisation?</b> And who&#x27;s responsible for that? Internal comms, right? But a lot of that info comes from outside - think social media monitoring, user feedback - so maybe it&#x27;s external comms?</li><li>Short answer: <b>integrate external comms, internal comms &amp; knowledge management.</b></li><li>But didn&#x27;t you read somewhere that the best external communications involves everyone? You need to turn your staff into <b>Social Media Ambassadors!</b>Better make sure your <b>training programme</b> is up to scratch!</li><li>But \&quot;staff as Ambassadors\&quot; only works if your staff are <i>engaged</i>. So get yourself an <b>employee engagement programme</b> too.</li><li>Of course, employee engagement and training go hand in hand, and both are supported by internal comms.</li><li>But aren&#x27;t engagement, training and internal comms <i>also</i> closely linked to your <b>innovation programme? </b>Engaged employees are not just the greatest communicators you could have – they&#x27;re also the <i>best source of innovation</i> you&#x27;ve got.<i>IF</i> you <b>empower them.</b></li><li>But you can&#x27;t just engage your <i>staff</i> in an ideation programme about your products - you have to <b>engage your users, audiences and stakeholders too.</b>Oh, and turn them into Ambassadors while you’re at it.</li><li>… but wait, <i>that&#x27;s</i> an <b>external comms responsibilities</b>, right?</li></ol><p></p><embed embedtype="media" url="http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/eurocomm2016-rpido-future-of-communications-part-3"/><p></p><ol><li><b>All of this begs one question:</b> External and internal communications, knowledge management, training, innovation &amp; ideation, employee engagement... how can you possibly fit all these pieces together, and create a company which <b><i>uses communication to innovate, and communicates its innovations?</i></b></li><li>The framework I like is to see all these teams as a single <b>Internal Innovation Community</b>.</li><li>Its missions: <b>Get your internal content out there</b></li><li><b>Get all useful knowledge - external</b> <b><i>and</i></b> <b>internal - to where it needs to go, inside</b> <b><i>and</i></b> <b>outside your organisation</b></li><li>And create an <b>innovation &amp; communications</b> <b><i>culture</i></b> throughout the organisation.</li><li>Because this is a strategy, and if it doesn&#x27;t tackle culture, then it&#x27;s <i>breakfast</i>.</li><li>And what&#x27;s at the heart of all this? Well, it&#x27;s a knowledge economy...</li><li><b>So go manage your knowledge</b></li></ol><p>PS Luckily the whole event took place in a library, so my last slide was rather apposite. But if anyone has a less sexist cartoon for a librarian, please let me know. </p><h3>More reading</h3><ul><li>the whole thing is derived from Time to integrate Innovation into your Comms strategy  (<i>August 2015</i>)</li><li>Fast, visual communications: a chat with Ezri and Charlelie (<i>October 2015</i>)</li><li>EuroComm 2016: Driving Business with Communication (IABC, <i>April 2016</i>)</li><li>Branding in the Age of Social Media (HBR, <i>March 2016</i>)</li><li>The most relevant resources on my TumblrHub are tagged innovation (143 resources), culture (14) and internal (as in <i>&#x27;internal communications &amp; knowledge management</i>&#x27;, 39).

Would you like to modify any of these themes, remove some, or add more?


#### You:
Now you are going to generate the Graphviz code for a Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of these resources and themes, where each resources is connected to the relevant themes. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be squares and have the same size. The nodes representing the themes should be ellipses, and sized according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node. 

I will show you an example of some code for a concept map visualising 4 resources and three themes: 
graph ER {
	fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"
	node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
	edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
	layout=neato
	node [shape=box]; theme1; "theme 2"; theme3;
	node [shape=ellipse]; resource1; "resource 2"; "resource 3"; "resource 4"; 

	theme1 -- resource1;
	theme1 -- "resource 2";
    theme1 -- "resource 3";
	theme3 -- "resource 2";	
	"theme 2" -- "resource 2";
	theme3 -- resource1;
	theme3 -- "resource 4";	
	"theme 2" -- "resource 4";		
	label = "\n\A concept map\of your resources by theme";
	fontsize=20;
}

Now provide the same sort of code for the resources and themes, using the resource titles and the themes.

#### ChatGPT:
Here's the Graphviz code for an Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of the provided resources and themes. Each resource is connected to the relevant themes, with resources represented as squares and themes as ellipses. The size of the theme nodes varies according to their importance.

```dot

This code will create a concept map with resources and themes as described. You can use this code with a Graphviz tool to visualize the connections between your resources and themes.


#### You:
Please update the visualisation as follows. The nodes representing the themes should be grey-filled ellipses, with their size adjusted according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node, and a correspondingly larger font size. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be yellow-filled rectangles. All Resource titles should fit snugly within their nodes' boundaries. Their texts should ideally all have the same font size, unless the title is very long. As the Resources' titles are often long, include labels for each Resource. Each Resource's label should be the same as the Resource's title, except that you should insert a linebreak ("\n") just before any hyphens, or just after any commas or full stops, and remove any reference to the publisher. If there are no such punctuation marks, insert a linebreak ("\n") after every 4 or 5 words. Remove any line breaks at the end of the Resource labels.

Reduce node separation to make the concept map compact, but avoid overlaps.

I will show you an example of some code for a concept map visualising 4 resources and three themes: 
graph ER {
	fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"
	node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
	edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]
	layout=neato
	edge [penwidth=1.5];
	overlap=false;
	nodesep=0.1; // Reduced node separation
	ranksep=0.5; // Reduced rank separation
	// Themes with labels and fontsize
	"Theme 1 title" [width=3, height=2, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
	"Theme 2 title" [width=1.5, height=1, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
	"Theme 3 title" [width=2, height=1, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
	// Resources with labels and adjusted width and height
	  "Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource Title 1 \n needs a linebreak", width=2, height=0.8, fontsize=10];
	"Resource 2 Title is very long and so has two linebreaks, a bigger box and a smaller font - New York Times" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 2 Title is very long \n and so has two linebreaks, a bigger \n box and a smaller font", width=2.5, height=1, fontsize=9];
	"Resource 3 Title is shorter - Nieman Lab" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 3 Title is short", width=1.5, height=0.8, fontsize=10];
	"Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow, label="Resource 4 Title has \n - a hyphen", width=2, height=1, fontsize=10];

"Theme 1 title" --  "Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak"
"Theme 1 title" -- "Resource 2 Title is very long and so has two linebreaks, a bigger box and a smaller font - New York Times" 
"Theme 1 title" --  "Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen"
"Theme 2 title" --  "Resource 4 Title has - a hyphen"
"Theme 3 title" --  "Resource 3 Title is shorter - Nieman Lab"
"Theme 3 title" --   "Resource 1 Title needs a linebreak"

}

Now provide the same sort of code for the resources and themes we developed earlier.

```

This code will create a concept map that visually represents the connections between the themes and resources, with the layout and node styles as per your instructions. You can use this code with a Graphviz tool to generate the visual representation.


#### You:
I see that despite the resources stating that effective communication strategies must be connected to other strategies, you don't see any connections between the two biggest themes: "Communication strategy and business integration", and "Employee engagement and internal communication". Surely these must be interconnected, but how?

#### ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right. The themes "Communications Strategy and Business Integration" and "Employee Engagement and Internal Communication" are indeed interconnected, especially in the context of organizational effectiveness and strategy. Effective communication strategies are often integral to employee engagement, and vice versa. Integrating these strategies can lead to a more cohesive and effective organizational approach. Let's update the Graphviz code to reflect this interconnection:
