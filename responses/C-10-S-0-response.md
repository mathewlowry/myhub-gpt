Please now act as a superb organiser and classifier of ideas and content. First identify and briefly summarise the top themes running through some or all of the above resources. For each theme list the relevant resources. Please list the most important themes - those relevant to the most resources - first. Please ensure each theme's title is short, and only provide at most 6 themes to start with. Then ask me if I want you to remove some themes, or generate more, or rename some.

## ChatGPT

Based on the articles provided, the top themes running through the resources can be summarized as follows:  
  
1. Responsible AI and Ethical Use:  
- Article: "Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…"  
- Article: "I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened"  
  
2. Advancements in Language Models:  
- Article: "A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI Releases Sensational New AI Model"  
  
3. Consequences of the AI Bubble:  
- Article: "What kind of bubble is AI?"  
  
4. Limitations and Dangers of Automated Chatbots:  
- Article: "Oops! We Automated Bullshit"  
  
Please let me know if you would like me to remove any themes, generate more themes, or rename existing themes.

## You

Now you are going to generate the Graphviz code for a Entity-Relation Data Model concept map of these resources and themes, where each resources is connected to the relevant themes. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be squares and have the same size. The nodes representing the themes should be ellipses, and sized according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node.  
  
I will show you an example of some code for a concept map visualising 4 resources and three themes:  
graph ER {  
fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"  
node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
layout=neato  
node [shape=box]; theme1; "theme 2"; theme3;  
node [shape=ellipse]; resource1; "resource 2"; "resource 3"; "resource 4";  
  
theme1 -- resource1;  
theme1 -- "resource 2";  
theme1 -- "resource 3";  
theme3 -- "resource 2";  
"theme 2" -- "resource 2";  
theme3 -- resource1;  
theme3 -- "resource 4";  
"theme 2" -- "resource 4";  
label = "\n\A concept map\of your resources by theme";  
fontsize=20;  
}  
  
Now provide the same sort of code for the resources and themes, using the resource titles and the themes.

## ChatGPT

```dot  
graph ER {  
fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"  
node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"]  
layout=neato  
node [shape=box]; "Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…"; "I Trained ChatGPT on My Notes To Create Content. Here’s What Happened"; "A Quiet Revolution? Mistral AI Releases Sensational New AI Model"; "What kind of bubble is AI?"; "Oops! We Automated Bullshit"  
  
node [shape=ellipse, width=1.2]; "Responsible AI and Ethical Use"; "Advancements in Language Models"; "Consequences of the AI Bubble"; "Limitations and Dangers of Automated Chatbots"  
  
"Responsible AI and Ethical Use" -- "Artificial General Bullshit. AI, AGI, and its other hallucinations…"

"Limitations and Dangers of Automated Chatbots" -- "Oops! We Automated Bullshit"  
  
label = "\n\A concept map of resources by theme";  
fontsize = 20;  
}  
```  
  
Please let me know if you'd like any modifications to the code or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

## You

Please update the visualisation as follows. The nodes representing the themes should be grey-filled ellipses, with their size adjusted according to their importance: the most important theme should have the largest node, and a correspondingly larger font size. The map's nodes representing the resources should all be yellow-filled rectangles. All Resource titles should fit snugly within their nodes' boundaries. Their texts should ideally all have the same font size, unless the title is very long. As the Resources' titles are often long, include labels for each Resource. Each Resource's label should be the same as the Resource's title, except that you should insert a linebreak ("\n") just before any hyphens, or just after any commas or full stops, and remove any reference to the publisher. If there are no such punctuation marks, insert a linebreak ("\n") after every 4 or 5 words. Remove any line breaks at the end of the Resource labels.  
  
Reduce node separation to make the concept map compact, but avoid overlaps.
