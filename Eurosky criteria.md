These criteria underpin most decisions:
- which Eurosky commons component to support?
- which consultancy project to offer?
- what public content to create?
- which project to support financially?

A first list:
- **startup support**: some projects will support the development of individual startups by providing development support, help accessing finance, mentoring, etc. Note that only startups signed up to the Covenant will be considered
- **support multiple startups:** any project or development which lifts multiple startups at once will have higher priority. Note:
    - this will include most if not all **cross-protocol** and **protocol interoperability** projects, as they support startups in both Fediverse and ATmosphere by growing both ecosystems
    - the eurosky development pipeline is specifically designed to identify developments that multiple startups need (see [[Eurosky Commons]])
- **grow decentralised social media** in Europe: growing the ecosystem
    - creates two benefits:
        - a bigger user base for our startups
        - helps move Europeans away from dependence on US/China platforms.
    - Projects fulfilling this criteria will, inter alia, support the adoption of ATproto by organisations in priority sectors (below), the public sector, civil society… tbc
- **priority sectors:** projects supporting existing organisations and new startups in the following sectors will be prioritised
    - newsmedia & factchecking
    - science
    - public sector, particularly public participation in policy
- **social benefits**: projects which will create social benefits will be prioritised. Social benefits include:
    - improving mental wellbeing
    - protecting disadvantaged groups
    - participatory citizenship
    - …tbc - check against EU Horizon criteria
- **support EU regulation compliance**: developments which make it easier for startups to meet EU law will be prioritised.
