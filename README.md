# Welcome to the MyHub.ai "Experiments wiki"


**Hi I'm Mathew, and this is not my main site.**

*(This is version 3 of this homepage, published on my experimental wiki using the [permanent versions pattern](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e). Version control in the footer.)*

If you've stumbled here by mistake, it might be better to start with [my About Page](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/about/) on [my Hub](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/), where you'll find all the things I Like, Think and Do. 

I created this massive wiki to share with a more limited audience my unfinished drafts and early ideas. Similarly to [Taurean's "backstage" site](https://backstage.taurean.work/) it's a bit of a mess and *"primarily an extension of my private notes... see it less like a curated public museum of content and more like entering my messy lived-in home."*

As such there's a bit of everything, but two interrelated subjects predominate:

## Decentralised collective intelligence

This is the big picture underpinning most of what I've been working on for more years than I care to remember. One possible starting point: a 4-part blog post from 1 January, 2023 - [A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4).

More recently I began exploring the different information ecosystems that could support these ideas (see [[AI4Communities intro]]), since Q1 2026 I'm focusing on the Atmosphere - the ecosystem underpinned by ATproto, the protocol developed originally by Bluesky. 

## Adding the ".ai" to "myhub.ai"

The original purpose of this wiki was to explore adding an LLM to MyHub.ai, which was the idea from the outset (the hint's in the TLD), with the longterm goal being "*creating a decentralised, open-source ecosystem ... developing cooperatively-owned AI engines to benefit society as a whole*" ([How Artificial Intelligence will finance Collective Intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b)).

But as anyone who has played with any LLM knows, getting the best out of them is not easy. You need to try stuff out, compare results and try some more. You need, in other words, to experiment.

The quickest way to experiment with integrating an LLM into MyHub.ai was to integrate ChatGPT with it and let MyHub.ai Early Adopters play with it (see [ChatGPT integration free trial, Bullshit, Botshit and Bubbles](https://myhub.ai/items/chatgpt-integration-free-trial-bullshit-botshit-and-bubbles-newsletter-3)), so I thought I'd share my research as I go. And given that I manage my research notes in Obsidian, sharing them here via a **massive wiki** was the obvious solution (read more [[about this massive wiki]]).  

That was all done using ChatGPT3.5, which is why the above post shows that I was somewhat underwhelmed with the results - earlier versions of this page have more details.
