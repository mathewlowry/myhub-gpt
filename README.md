# MyHub/GPT integration experimental programme

## Introduction
**A guide to the experimental programme underway to design MyHub/GPT integration.**

Integrating MyHub.ai with an LLM has been [the idea from the outset](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4) (the hint's in the ".ai"), with the longterm goal being "*creating a decentralised, open-source ecosystem ... developing cooperatively-owned AI engines to benefit society as a whole*" ([How Artificial Intelligence will finance Collective Intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b)).

The quickest way for me to discover the most valuable way(s) of integrating a Hub with an LLM today, however, is to use ChatGPT. Earlier this summer, therefore, I added a pilot version of ChatGPT integration to MyHub.ai to support the research (see [[Pilot integration]]).

I am sharing the results of this research in the hope others can contribute their thoughts and ideas. 

## Where next
New to Github? Check out [[How to use this repository]], as otherwise you'll have to find the files manually.

Otherwise the links will work so here are some places to start:
* How MyHub/ChatGPT [[Pilot integration]] currently works. If you have your own ChatGPT API key *and* a Hub, email me and I'll set this up for you
* [[chatgpt integration system]]: What will the LLM integration into MyHub.ai look like?
* [[chatgpt experiment - method]]: how are we testing it?
* [[ChatGPT Experiment log]]: menu of experiments. It pulls out and/or links to:
	* [[Summarisers]]: the prompts used by MyHub to create summaries of notes. Each Summarisers can be applied with a different length (X), as they all end with "Limit your response to X words".
	* [[Agent Prompts]]: the agent prompts used in the experiments
	* analyses of each experiment  
* [[Ideas]]: this is where I drop ideas for future experiments, generally as I analyse experiments
