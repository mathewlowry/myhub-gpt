## Experiment 5: 2023-10-22
While I investigate visualisation options for finishing Experiment 4, I've decided to build on the results of Experiment 1 to create a weekly newsletter:
* Collection 5: stuff I Hubbed week ending 2023-10-22: [[C-5-AllNotes]]
* Prompt: [[Prompt 5 - Ideas from recent articles]]
	* designed to reflect the recommend from Experiment 1: "Use ChatGPT outputs as idea generators rather than sources of literal truth"
	* I also included the requirement to follow the ideas with a newsletter-like summary as in [[Prompt 1 - newsletter A]] . It didn't really do that, but when I did ask it a 2nd time it included summary/links after each idea, which was a nice bonus.   
	* I also asked it for a newsletter summary without an editorial
* Responses
	* C-5-AllNotes-response-P5
	* C-5-AllNotes-response-P1b
## Experiments 2 - 4, 2023-08-18: 
Experiments Experiments 2 & 3 were early experiments into thematic analysis and visualisation performed only via the chatgpt/myhub integration pilot, before I had the experimental system worked out. I then made Experiment 4 by tweaking the collections and prompts from Experiment 3.
