## About atproto.science

**Scientists have been early adopters of Bluesky,** recognising its potential for useful, constructive conversations about their work without the bot-infested toxicity of X.

**But Bluesky is just the start,** with a wave of new apps emerging, all underpinned by the ATprotocol - the same technology used by Bluesky. That means: 

* one "ATproto" account works on all the apps, which can freely interoperate
* *you* can move freely between them, keeping your content and friends
* so no-one is "locked in" to one platform, and everyone can innovate to create better experiences.

**atproto.science is therefore an ecosystem**: a network of scientists and scientific institutions, using a suite of interoperable apps, sharing and discussing their work. 

**atproto.science is also an opportunity**: to free science from the stranglehold of enshittification-powered scientific publishers and platforms, and to ensure science is not muzzled by corporate social media.

**This movement is just beginning,** with its first innovators assembling in Vancouver, March 2026 to exchange ideas and map the path forward.  [[event-atmosphere2026|Join us there.]]
