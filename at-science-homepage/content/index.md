# Better social media for science

**We're building communities and developing tools for publishing, curating, sharing, and discussing academic research online using decentralized protocols.**

C2A: join us!
## About atproto.science

**Scientists have been early adopters of Bluesky,** recognising its potential for useful, constructive conversations about their work in an open social media environment where users and communities have better control of their data and experience. 

**But Bluesky is just the start**, with a wave of new apps emerging, all underpinned by the ATprotocol - the same underlying technology. 
### ATScience is a [Community](https://atproto-science.github.io/at-science-homepage/people)

Join a network of researchers, developers, and institutions collaborating through interoperable apps. One ATProto account works everywhere—share your work, connect with colleagues, and move freely between platforms while keeping full control of your content and relationships.
